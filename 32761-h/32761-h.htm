<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p class="cap">The sketches and poems in this volume were written
at a time when the author was engaged in the
practice of a laborious profession. It was the intention
of Mr. Rhodes to collect them from the various
newspapers and periodicals in which they had appeared,
and publish them in book-form whenever he could obtain
a respite from his arduous duties. But before he
carried out his long-cherished object he died, in the
prime of his manhood and the ripeness of his literary
life. Many of his poems were written for the monthly
gatherings of the Bohemian Club. There, when Caxton's
name was announced, his literary friends thronged
about him, confident of the rich treat the brain of their
beloved poet had provided for them. His wit was keen
and sparkling, without a shade of malice; and many an
anecdote, that began with some delightful absurdity,
closed in a pathos that showed the great versatility of
Caxton's genius. The Case of Summerfield, which is
perhaps the most ingenious of the tales in that peculiar
vein, was widely copied and warmly praised for the
originality of its plan and the skill of its execution.
The editor of this work has observed, as far as lay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
his power, the intention of the author in the selection
of those compositions which Mr. Rhodes had put aside
for compilation. With such a mass and variety of material
(for Caxton had been a busy worker) it was difficult
to select from productions all of which were excellent.
Few liberties have been taken with them; for, indeed,
Caxton was himself so conscientious in the arrangement
and correction of his manuscript, that, with the exception
of some slight and unimportant alterations, this
book goes before his friends and the public in the same
order as the author would have chosen had he been
spared to perform the task.</p>

<h2>IN MEMORIAM.</h2>
<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p class="cap">At the time when, according to custom, Mr. Rhodes's
death was formally announced to the several
Courts of Record in San Francisco, one of the learned
Judges urged the publication of his writings in some
form which would give the bar a permanent memorial
of one of it's most esteemed members, and to
them their proper place in American literature. This
has been accomplished by the present volume. It is
sincerely to be hoped that while it will largely add to Mr.
Rhodes's reputation, it may also serve to furnish a most
interesting family some substantial aid in the struggle
with life, from which the beloved husband and tender
father has unhappily been removed.</p>

<p>William Henry Rhodes was born July 16, 1822, in
Windsor, North Carolina. His mother died when he
was six years old, and his father, Col. E. A. Rhodes,
sent him to Princeton, New Jersey, to be educated
at the seat of learning established there. Col. Rhodes
was subsequently appointed United States Consul at
Galveston, Texas, and without completing his college
course, the son followed his father to his new home.
There he diligently pursued his studies. He found
many young men like himself, ambitious and zealous
in acquiring information, and these he associated with
himself in literary and debating clubs, where the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
important matters of natural science and political economy
were discussed. The effect of this self-bestowed
education was most marked. It remained with him all
his life. He was thoroughly versed in the political history
of the country, and possessed an amount of knowledge
concerning the career, motives and objects of politics,
parties and public men, which, had he ever chosen
to embark in public life, would have made him distinguished
and successful. No one ever discussed with
him the questions connected with the theory of our
government without a thorough respect for the sincerity
of his convictions, and the ability with which
they were maintained. He was, in theory, a thorough
partisan of the Southern political and constitutional
school of ideas, and never abandoned them. But he
advocated them without passion or apparent prejudice,
and at all times shrunk from active connection with
politics as a trade. He was an idealist in law, in
science and government, and perhaps his early training,
self-imposed and self-contained, had much to do
with his peculiarities.</p>

<p>In 1844, he entered Harvard Law School, where he
remained for two years. Here, as at home among his
young friends, he was a master-spirit and leader. He
was an especial favorite of his instructors; was noted
for his studious and exemplary habits, while his genial
and courteous manners won the lasting friendship of
his classmates and companions. His fondness for weaving
the problems of science with fiction, which became
afterwards so marked a characteristic of his literary
efforts, attracted the especial attention of his professors;
and had Mr. Rhodes devoted himself to this then novel
department of letters, he would have become, no doubt,
greatly distinguished as a writer; and the great master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of scientific fiction, Jules Verne, would have found the
field of his efforts already sown and reaped by the young
Southern student. But his necessities and parental
choice, conspired to keep him at "the lawless science
of the law;" and literature become an incident of life,
rather than its end and aim. He never really loved the
law. He rather lived by it than in it. He became a
good lawyer, but was an unwilling practitioner. He
understood legal principles thoroughly. He loved the
higher lessons of truth and justice, of right and wrong,
<i>fas et nefas</i>, which they illustrated; but he bent himself
to the necessary details of professional life&mdash;to the
money-getting part of it&mdash;with a peculiar and constantly
increasing reluctance. The yoke of labor galled
him, and always more severely. An opportunity to
speak and write what was most pleasing to his taste,
which set him free as a liberated prisoner of thought,
his untrammeled and wandering imagination extravagantly
interweaving scientific principles, natural forces,
and elemental facts, in some witch's dance of fancy,
where he dissolved in its alchemy, earth, air and water,
and created a world of his own, or destroyed that beneath
his feet, was of more value to him, though it
brought him no gain, than a stiff cause in courts which
bound him to dry details of weary facts and legal propositions,
though every hour of his time bestowed a golden
reward.</p>

<p>His early professional life was passed in Galveston.
He was measurably successful in it, and won many
friends by his gallant and chivalrous advocacy of the
causes intrusted to him. His personal popularity elevated
him to a Probate Judgeship in Texas. This office
he filled with honor; and at the expiration of his term,
he returned, after a brief sojourn in New York, to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
native state and town, where he practiced his profession
until 1850. In this year he caught the inspiration of
adventure in the new El Dorado, and sailed for California.
From that time he continued a citizen of this
State. He was widely known and universally respected.
He practiced his profession with diligence; but mind
and heart were inviting him to the life and career of a
man of letters; and he was every day sacrificed to duty,
as he esteemed it. He was too conscientious to become
indifferent to his clients' interests: but he had no ambition
for distinction as a jurist. He was utterly indifferent
to the profits of his labors. He cared nothing for
money, or for those who possessed it. His real life and
real enjoyments were of a far different sort; and his
genius was perpetually bound to the altar, and sacrificed
by a sense of obligation, and a pride which never permitted
him to abandon the profession for which he was
educated. Like many another man of peculiar mental
qualities, he distrusted himself where he should have
been most confident. The writer has often discussed
with Mr. Rhodes his professional and literary life,
urged him to devote himself to literature, and endeavored
to point out to him the real road to success. But
he dreaded the venture; and like a swift-footed blooded
horse, fit to run a course for a man's life, continued on
his way, harnessed to a plow, and broke his heart in
the harness!</p>

<p>William Henry Rhodes will long be remembered by
his contemporaries at the Bar of California as a man of
rare genius, exemplary habits, high honor, and gentle
manners, with wit and humor unexcelled. His writings
are illumined by powerful fancy, scientific knowledge,
and a reasoning power which gave to his most weird
imaginations the similitude of truth and the apparel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
facts. Nor did they, nor do they, do him justice. He
could have accomplished far more had circumstances
been propitious to him. That they were not, is and will
always be a source of regret. That, environed as he
was, he achieved so much more than his fellows, has
made his friends always loyal to him while living, and
fond in their memories of him when dead. We give
his productions to the world with satisfaction, not
unmingled with regret that what is, is only the faint
echo, the unfulfilled promise of what might have been.
Still, may we say, and ask those who read these sketches
to say with us, as they lay down the volume: "<i>Habet
enim justam venerationem, quicquid excellit.</i>"</p>

<h3><i>THE CASE OF SUMMERFIELD.</i></h3>


<p class="cap">The following manuscript was found among the
effects of the late Leonidas Parker, in relation to
one Gregory Summerfield, or, as he was called at the
time those singular events first attracted public notice,
"The Man with a Secret." Parker was an eminent
lawyer, a man of firm will, fond of dabbling in the
occult sciences, but never allowing this tendency to
interfere with the earnest practice of his profession.
This astounding narrative is prefaced by the annexed
clipping from the "Auburn Messenger" of November 1,
1870:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A few days since, we called public attention to the singular
conduct of James G. Wilkins, justice of the peace for the
"Cape Horn" district, in this county, in discharging without
trial a man named Parker, who was, as we still think,
seriously implicated in the mysterious death of an old man
named Summerfield, who, our readers will probably remember,
met so tragical an end on the line of the Central Pacific
Railroad, in the month of October last. We have now to
record another bold outrage on public justice, in connection
with the same affair. The grand jury of Placer County has
just adjourned, without finding any bill against the person
named above. Not only did they refuse to find a true bill,
or to make any presentment, but they went one step further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
toward the exoneration of the offender: they specially <i>ignored</i>
the indictment which our district attorney deemed it his
duty to present. The main facts in relation to the arrest and
subsequent discharge of Parker may be summed up in few
words:</p>

<p>It appears that, about the last of October, one Gregory
Summerfield, an old man nearly seventy years of age, in
company with Parker, took passage for Chicago, <i>via</i> the
Pacific Railroad, and about the middle of the afternoon
reached the neighborhood of Cape Horn, in this county.
Nothing of any special importance seems to have attracted
the attention of any of the passengers toward these persons
until a few moments before passing the dangerous curve in
the track, overlooking the North Fork of the American
River, at the place called Cape Horn. As our readers are
aware, the road at this point skirts a precipice, with rocky
perpendicular sides, extending to the bed of the stream,
nearly seventeen hundred feet below. Before passing the
curve, Parker was heard to comment upon the sublimity of
the scenery they were approaching, and finally requested the
old man to leave the car and stand upon the open platform,
in order to obtain a better view of the tremendous chasm
and the mountains just beyond. The two men left the car,
and a moment afterwards a cry of horror was heard by all
the passengers, and the old man was observed to fall at
least one thousand feet upon the crags below. The train
was stopped for a few moments, but, fearful of a collision if
any considerable length of time should be lost in an unavailing
search for the mangled remains, it soon moved on
again, and proceeded as swiftly as possible to the next
station. There the miscreant Parker was arrested, and conveyed
to the office of the nearest justice of the peace for
examination. We understand that he refused to give any
detailed account of the transaction, only that "the deceased
either fell or was thrown off from the moving train."</p>

<p>The examination was postponed until the arrival of Parker's
counsel, O'Connell &amp; Kilpatrick, of Grass Valley, and
after they reached Cape Horn not a single word could be
extracted from the prisoner. It is said that the inquisition
was a mere farce; there being no witnesses present except
one lady passenger, who, with commendable spirit, volunteered
to lay over one day, to give in her testimony. We
also learn that, after the trial, the justice, together with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
prisoner and his counsel, were closeted in secret session for
more than two hours; at the expiration of which time the
judge resumed his seat upon the bench, and discharged the
prisoner!</p>

<p>Now, we have no desire to do injustice toward any of the
parties to this singular transaction, much less to arm public
sentiment against an innocent man. But we do affirm that
<i>there is, there must be</i>, some profound mystery at the bottom
of this affair, and we shall do our utmost to fathom the secret.</p></div>

<p>Yes, there is a secret and mystery connected with the
disappearance of Summerfield, and the sole object of this
communication is to clear it up, and place myself right
in the public estimation. But, in order to do so, it
becomes essentially necessary to relate all the circumstances
connected with my first and subsequent acquaintance
with Summerfield. To do this intelligibly,
I shall have to go back twenty-two years.</p>

<p>It is well known amongst my intimate friends that I
resided in the late Republic of Texas for many years
antecedent to my immigration to this State. During
the year 1847, whilst but a boy, and residing on the sea-beach
some three or four miles from the city of Galveston,
Judge Wheeler, at that time Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of Texas, paid us a visit, and brought
with him a gentleman, whom he had known several years
previously on the Sabine River, in the eastern part of
that State. This gentleman was introduced to us by the
name of Summerfield. At that time he was past the
prime of life, slightly gray, and inclined to corpulency.
He was of medium height, and walked proudly erect, as
though conscious of superior mental attainments. His
face was one of those which, once seen, can never be
forgotten. The forehead was broad, high, and protuberant.
It was, besides, deeply graven with wrinkles,
and altogether was the most intellectual that I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
ever seen. It bore some resemblance to that of Sir
Isaac Newton, but still more to Humboldt or Webster.
The eyes were large, deep-set, and lustrous with a light
that seemed kindled in their own depths. In color they
were gray, and whilst in conversation absolutely blazed
with intellect. His mouth was large, but cut with all
the precision of a sculptor's chiseling. He was rather
pale, but, when excited, his complexion lit up with a
sudden rush of ruddy flushes, that added something
like beauty to his half-sad and half-sardonic expression.
A word and a glance told me at once, this is a most
extraordinary man.</p>

<p>Judge Wheeler knew but little of the antecedents of
Summerfield. He was of Northern birth, but of what
State it is impossible to say definitely. Early in life he
removed to the frontier of Arkansas, and pursued for
some years the avocation of village schoolmaster. It
was the suggestion of Judge Wheeler that induced him
to read law. In six months' time he had mastered Story's
Equity, and gained an important suit, based upon
one of its most recondite principles. But his heart
was not in the legal profession, and he made almost
constant sallies into the fields of science, literature and
art. He was a natural mathematician, and was the most
profound and original arithmetician in the Southwest.
He frequently computed the astronomical tables for the
almanacs of New Orleans, Pensacola and Mobile, and
calculated eclipse, transit and observations with ease
and perfect accuracy. He was also deeply read in metaphysics,
and wrote and published, in the old <i>Democratic
Review</i> for 1846, an article on the "Natural Proof
of the Existence of a Deity," that for beauty of language,
depth of reasoning, versatility of illustration,
and compactness of logic, has never been equaled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
The only other publication which at that period he had
made, was a book that astonished all of his friends,
both in title and execution. It was called "The Desperadoes
of the West," and purported to give minute
details of the lives of some of the most noted duelists
and blood-stained villains in the Western States. But
the book belied its title. It is full of splendid description
and original thought. No volume in the language
contains so many eloquent passages and such gorgeous
imagery, in the same space. His plea for immortality,
on beholding the execution of one of the most noted
culprits of Arkansas, has no parallel in any living language
for beauty of diction and power of thought. As
my sole object in this communication is to defend myself,
some acquaintance with the mental resources of
Summerfield is absolutely indispensable; for his death
was the immediate consequence of his splendid attainments.
Of chemistry he was a complete master. He
describes it in his article on a Deity, above alluded to,
as the "Youngest Daughter of the Sciences, born amid
flames, and cradled in rollers of fire." If there were
any one science to which he was more specially devoted
than to any and all others, it was chemistry. But he
really seemed an adept in all, and shone about everywhere
with equal lustre.</p>

<p>Many of these characteristics were mentioned by
Judge Wheeler at the time of Summerfield's visit to
Galveston, but others subsequently came to my knowledge,
after his retreat to Brownsville, on the banks of
the Rio Grande. There he filled the position of judge
of the District Court, and such was his position just
previous to his arrival in this city in the month of September
of the past year.</p>

<p>One day toward the close of last September, an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
man rapped at my office door, and on invitation came
in, and advancing, called me by name. Perceiving that
I did not at first recognize him, he introduced himself
as Gregory Summerfield. After inviting him to a seat,
I scrutinized his features more closely, and quickly
identified him as the same person whom I had met
twenty-two years before. He was greatly altered in appearance,
but the lofty forehead and the gray eye were
still there, unchanged and unchangeable. He was not
quite so stout, but more ruddy in complexion, and exhibited
some symptoms, as I then thought, of intemperate
drinking. Still there was the old charm of intellectual
superiority in his conversation, and I welcomed
him to California as an important addition to
her mental wealth.</p>

<p>It was not many minutes before he requested a private
interview. He followed me into my back office,
carefully closed the door after him and locked it. We
had scarcely seated ourselves before he inquired of me
if I had noticed any recent articles in the newspapers
respecting the discovery of the art of decomposing
water so as to fit it for use as a fuel for ordinary purposes?</p>

<p>I replied that I had observed nothing new upon that
subject since the experiments of Agassiz and Professor
Henry, and added that, in my opinion, the expensive
mode of reduction would always prevent its use.</p>

<p>In a few words he then informed me that he had
made the discovery that the art was extremely simple,
and the expense attending the decomposition so slight
as to be insignificant.</p>

<p>Presuming then that the object of his visit to me was
to procure the necessary forms to get out a patent for
the right, I congratulated him upon his good fortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and was about to branch forth with a description of
some of the great benefits that must ensue to the community,
when he suddenly and somewhat uncivilly requested
me to "be silent," and listen to what he had
to say.</p>

<p>He began with some general remarks about the inequality
of fortune amongst mankind, and instanced
himself as a striking example of the fate of those men,
who, according to all the rules of right, ought to be
near the top, instead of at the foot of the ladder of
fortune. "But," said he, springing to his feet with
impulsive energy, "I have now the means at my command
of rising superior to fate, or of inflicting incalculable
ills upon the whole human race."</p>

<p>Looking at him more closely, I thought I could
detect in his eye the gleam of madness; but I remained
silent and awaited further developments. But my scrutiny,
stolen as it was, had been detected, and he replied
at once to the expression of my face: "No, sir; I am
neither drunk nor a maniac; I am in deep earnest in all
that I say; and I am fully prepared, by actual experiment,
to demonstrate beyond all doubt the truth of all
I claim."</p>

<p>For the first time I noticed that he carried a small
portmanteau in his hand; this he placed upon the table,
unlocked it, and took out two or three small volumes, a
pamphlet or two, and a small, square, wide-mouthed
vial, hermetically sealed.</p>

<p>I watched him with profound curiosity, and took note
of his slightest movements. Having arranged his books
to suit him, and placed the vial in a conspicuous position,
he drew up his chair very closely to my own, and
uttered in a half-hissing tone: "I demand one million
dollars for the contents of that bottle; and you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
raise it for me in the city of San Francisco within one
month, or scenes too terrible even for the imagination
to conceive, will surely be witnessed by every living
human being on the face of the globe."</p>

<p>The tone, the manner, and the absurd extravagance
of the demand, excited a faint smile upon my lips,
which he observed, but disdained to notice.</p>

<p>My mind was fully made up that I had a maniac to
deal with, and I prepared to act accordingly. But I
ascertained at once that my inmost thoughts were read
by the remarkable man before me, and seemed to be
anticipated by him in advance of their expression.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, "Mr. Summerfield, you would
oblige me by informing me fully of the grounds of your
claim, and the nature of your discovery."</p>

<p>"That is the object of my visit," he replied. "I
claim to have discovered the key which unlocks the
constituent gases of water, and frees each from the embrace
of the other, at a single touch."</p>

<p>"You mean to assert," I rejoined, "that you can
make water burn itself up?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more nor less," he responded, "except
this: to insist upon the consequences of the secret, if
my demand be not at once complied with."</p>

<p>Then, without pausing for a moment to allow me to
make a suggestion, as I once or twice attempted to do,
he proceeded in a clear and deliberate manner, in these
words: "I need not inform you, sir, that when this
earth was created, it consisted almost wholly of vapor,
which, by condensation, finally became water. The
oceans now occupy more than two thirds of the entire
surface of the globe. The continents are mere islands
in the midst of the seas. They are everywhere ocean-bound,
and the hyperborean north is hemmed in by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
open polar seas. Such is my first proposition. My
second embraces the constituent elements of water.
What is that thing which we call water? Chemistry,
that royal queen of all the sciences, answers readily:
'Water is but the combination of two gases, oxygen and
hydrogen, and in the proportion of eight to one.' In
other words, in order to form water, take eight parts of
oxygen and one of hydrogen, mix them together, and the
result or product is water. You smile, sir, because, as
you very properly think, these are the elementary principles
of science, and are familiar to the minds of every
schoolboy twelve years of age. Yes! but what next?
Suppose you take these same gases and mix them in any
other proportion, I care not what, and the instantaneous
result is heat, flame, combustion of the intensest description.
The famous Drummond Light, that a few years
ago astonished Europe&mdash;what is that but the ignited
flame of a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen projected
against a small piece of lime? What was harmless as
water, becomes the most destructive of all known objects
when decomposed and mixed in any other proportion.</p>

<p>"Now, suppose I fling the contents of this small vial
into the Pacific Ocean, what would be the result? Dare
you contemplate it for an instant? I do not assert that
the entire surface of the sea would instantaneously
bubble up into insufferable flames; no, but from the
nucleus of a circle, of which this vial would be the
centre, lurid radii of flames would gradually shoot outward,
until the blazing circumference would roll in vast
billows of fire, upon the uttermost shores. Not all the
dripping clouds of the deluge could extinguish it. Not
all the tears of saints and angels could for an instant
check its progress. On and onward it would sweep,
with the steady gait of destiny, until the continents would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
melt with fervent heat, the atmosphere glare with the
ominous conflagration, and all living creatures, in land
and sea and air, perish in one universal catastrophe."</p>

<p>Then suddenly starting to his feet, he drew himself
up to his full height, and murmured solemnly, "I feel
like a God! and I recognize my fellow-men but as pigmies
that I spurn beneath my feet."</p>

<p>"Summerfield," said I calmly, "there must be some
strange error in all this. You are self-deluded. The
weapon which you claim to wield is one that a good
God and a beneficent Creator would never intrust to the
keeping of a mere creature. What, sir! create a world
as grand and beautiful as this, and hide within its
bosom a principle that at any moment might inwrap it
in flames, and sink all life in death? I'll not believe it;
't were blasphemy to entertain the thought!"</p>

<p>"And yet," cried he passionately, "your Bible
prophesies the same irreverence. Look at your text in 2d
Peter, third chapter, seventh and twelfth verses. Are not
the elements to melt with fervent heat? Are not 'the
heavens to be folded together like a scroll?' Are not 'the
rocks to melt, the stars to fall and the moon to be
turned into blood?' Is not fire the next grand cyclic
consummation of all things here below? But I come
fully prepared to answer such objections. Your argument
betrays a narrow mind, circumscribed in its orbit,
and shallow in its depth. 'Tis the common thought of
mediocrity. You have read books too much, and
studied nature too little. Let me give you a lesson
to-day in the workshop of Omnipotence. Take a stroll
with me into the limitless confines of space, and let us
observe together some of the scenes transpiring at this
very instant around us. A moment ago you spoke
of the moon: what is she but an extinguished world?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
You spoke of the sun: what is he but a globe of flame?
But here is the <i>Cosmos</i> of Humboldt. Read this
paragraph."</p>

<p>As he said this he placed before me the <i>Cosmos</i> of
Humboldt, and I read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nor do the Heavens themselves teach unchangeable
permanency in the works of creation. Change is observable
there quite as rapid and complete as in the confines of our
solar system. In the year 1752, one of the small stars in
the constellation Cassiopeia blazed up suddenly into an
orb of the first magnitude, gradually decreased in brilliancy,
and finally disappeared from the skies. Nor has it ever
been visible since that period for a single moment, either
to the eye or to the telescope. It burned up and was lost
in space.</p></div>

<p>"Humboldt," he added, "has not told us who set
that world on fire!"</p>

<p>"But," resumed he, "I have still clearer proofs."
Saying this, he thrust into my hands the last London
<i>Quarterly</i>, and on opening the book at an article headed
"The Language of Light," I read with a feeling akin to
awe, the following passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Further, some stars exhibit changes of complexion in
themselves. Sirius, as before stated, was once a ruddy, or
rather a fiery-faced orb, but has now forgotten to blush, and
looks down upon us with a pure, brilliant smile, in which
there is no trace either of anger or of shame. On the countenances
of others, still more varied traits have rippled,
within a much briefer period of time. May not these be due
to some physiological revolutions, general or convulsive,
which are in progress in the particular orb, and which, by
affecting the constitution of its atmosphere, compel the
absorption or promote the transmission of particular rays?
The supposition appears by no means improbable, especially
if we call to mind the hydrogen volcanoes which have been
discovered on the photosphere of the sun. Indeed, there
are a few small stars which afford a spectrum of bright lines
instead of dark ones, and this we know denotes a gaseous
or vaporized state of things, from which it may be inferred
that such orbs are in a different condition from most of
their relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>And as, if for the very purpose of throwing light upon
this interesting question, an event of the most striking character
occurred in the heavens, almost as soon as the spectroscopists
were prepared to interpret it correctly.</p>

<p>On the 12th of May, 1866, a great conflagration, infinitely
larger than that of London or Moscow, was announced.
To use the expression of a distinguished astronomer, a world
was found to be on fire! A star, which till then had shone
weakly and unobtrusively in the <i>corona borealis</i>, suddenly
blazed up into a luminary of the second magnitude. In
the course of three days from its discovery in this new
character, by Birmingham, at Tuam, it had declined to
the third or fourth order of brilliancy. In twelve days,
dating from its first apparition in the Irish heavens, it had
sunk to the eighth rank, and it went on waning until the
26th of June, when it ceased to be discernible except
through the medium of the telescope. This was a remarkable,
though certainly not an unprecedented proceeding on
the part of a star; but one singular circumstance in its behavior
was that, after the lapse of nearly two months, it
began to blaze up again, though not with equal ardor, and
after maintaining its glow for a few weeks, and passing
through sundry phases of color, it gradually paled its fires,
and returned to its former insignificance. How many years
had elapsed since this awful conflagration actually took
place, it would be presumptuous to guess; but it must be
remembered that news from the heavens, though carried by
the fleetest of messengers, light, reaches us long after the
event has transpired, and that the same celestial carrier is
still dropping the tidings at each station it reaches in space,
until it sinks exhausted by the length of its flight.</p>

<p>As the star had suddenly flamed up, was it not a natural
supposition that it had become inwrapped in burning hydrogen,
which in consequence of some great convulsion had
been liberated in prodigious quantities, and then combining
with other elements, had set this hapless world on fire?
In such a fierce conflagration, the combustible gas would
soon be consumed, and the glow would therefore begin to
decline, subject, as in this case, to a second eruption, which
occasioned the renewed outburst of light on the 20th of
August.</p>

<p>By such a catastrophe, it is not wholly impossible that our
own globe may some time be ravaged; for if a word from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Almighty were to unloose for a few moments the bonds of
affinity which unite the elements of water, a single spark
would bring them together with a fury that would kindle
the funeral pyre of the human race, and be fatal to the
planet and all the works that are thereon.</p></div>

<p>"Your argument," he then instantly added, "is by
no means a good one. What do we know of the Supreme
Architect of the Universe, or of his designs?
He builds up worlds, and he pulls them down; he kindles
suns and he extinguishes them. He inflames the
comet, in one portion of its orbit, with a heat that no
human imagination can conceive of; and in another,
subjects the same blazing orb to a cold intenser than
that which invests forever the antarctic pole. All that
we know of Him we gather through His works. I have
shown you that He burns other worlds, why not this?
The habitable parts of our globe are surrounded by
water, and water you know is fire in possibility."</p>

<p>"But all this," I rejoined, "is pure, baseless, profitless
speculation."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," he answered. And then rising, he
seized the small vial, and handing it to me, requested
me to open it.</p>

<p>I confess I did so with some trepidation.</p>

<p>"Now smell it."</p>

<p>I did so.</p>

<p>"What odor do you perceive?"</p>

<p>"Potassium," I replied.</p>

<p>"Of course," he added, "you are familiar with the
chief characteristic of that substance. It ignites instantly
when brought in contact with water. Within
that little globule of potassium, I have imbedded a pill
of my own composition and discovery. The moment it
is liberated from the potassium, it commences the work
of decomposing the fluid on which it floats. The potassium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
at once ignites the liberated oxygen, and the
conflagration of this mighty globe is begun."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "begun, if you please, but your little
pill soon evaporates or sinks, or melts in the surrounding
seas, and your conflagration ends just where it
began."</p>

<p>"My reply to that suggestion could be made at once
by simply testing the experiment on a small scale, or a
large one, either. But I prefer at present to refute
your proposition by an argument drawn from nature
herself. If you correctly remember, the first time I had
the pleasure of seeing you was on the island of Galveston,
many years ago. Do you remember relating to
me at that time an incident concerning the effects of a
prairie on fire, that you had yourself witnessed but a
few days previously, near the town of Matagorde? If
I recollect correctly, you stated that on your return
journey from that place, you passed on the way the
charred remains of two wagon-loads of cotton, and
three human beings, that the night before had perished
in the flames; that three slaves, the property of a Mr.
Horton, had started a few days before to carry to market
a shipment of cotton; that a norther overtook them
on the treeless prairie, and a few minutes afterwards
they were surprised by beholding a line of rushing fire,
surging, roaring and advancing like the resistless billows
of an ocean swept by a gale; that there was no
time for escape, and they perished terribly in fighting
the devouring element?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I recollect the event."</p>

<p>"Now, then, I wish a reply to the simple question:
Did the single spark, that kindled the conflagration, consume
the negroes and their charge? No? But what
did? You reply, of course, that the spark set the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
prairie on fire; that each spear of grass added fuel
to the flame, and kindled by degrees a conflagration
that continued to burn so long as it could feed on fresh
material. The pillule in that vial is the little spark,
the oceans are the prairies, and the oxygen the fuel
upon which the fire is to feed until the globe perishes
in inextinguishable flames. The elementary substances
in that small vial recreate themselves; they are self-generating,
and when once fairly under way must necessarily
sweep onward, until the waters in all the seas are
exhausted. There is, however, one great difference between
the burning of a prairie and the combustion of an
ocean: the fire in the first spreads slowly, for the fuel
is difficult to ignite; in the last, it flies with the rapidity
of the wind, for the substance consumed is oxygen,
the most inflammable agent in nature."</p>

<p>Rising from my seat, I went to the washstand in the
corner of the apartment, and drawing a bowl half full
of Spring Valley water, I turned to Summerfield, and
remarked, "Words are empty, theories are ideal&mdash;but
facts are things."</p>

<p>"I take you at your word." So saying, he approached
the bowl, emptied it of nine-tenths of its contents, and
silently dropped the potassium-coated pill into the
liquid. The potassium danced around the edges of the
vessel, fuming, hissing, and blazing, as it always does,
and seemed on the point of expiring&mdash;when, to my astonishment
and alarm, a sharp explosion took place, and
in a second of time the water was blazing in a red, lurid
column, half way to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"For God's sake," I cried, "extinguish the flames,
or we shall set the building on fire!"</p>

<p>"Had I dropped the potassium into the bowl as you
prepared it," he quietly remarked, "the building would
indeed have been consumed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Lower and lower fell the flickering flames, paler and
paler grew the blaze, until finally the fire went out, and
I rushed up to see the effects of the combustion.</p>

<p>Not a drop of water remained in the vessel! Astonished
beyond measure at what I had witnessed, and
terrified almost to the verge of insanity, I approached
Summerfield, and tremblingly inquired, "To whom,
sir, is this tremendous secret known?" "To myself
alone," he responded; "and now answer me a question:
is it worth the money?"</p>

<p class="center"><span style="letter-spacing: 3em;">*******</span></p>

<p>It is entirely unnecessary to relate in detail the subsequent
events connected with this transaction. I will
only add a general statement, showing the results of my
negotiations. Having fully satisfied myself that Summerfield
actually held in his hands the fate of the whole
world, with its millions of human beings, and by experiment
having tested the combustion of sea-water, with
equal facility as fresh, I next deemed it my duty to call
the attention of a few of the principal men in San Francisco
to the extreme importance of Summerfield's discovery.</p>

<p>A leading banker, a bishop, a chemist, two State
university professors, a physician, a judge, and two
Protestant divines, were selected by me to witness the
experiment on a large scale. This was done at a small
sand-hill lake, near the sea-shore, but separated from it
by a ridge of lofty mountains, distant not more than ten
miles from San Francisco. Every single drop of water
in the pool was burnt up in less than fifteen minutes.
We next did all that we could to pacify Summerfield,
and endeavored to induce him to lower his price and
bring it within the bounds of a reasonable possibility.
But without avail. He began to grow urgent in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
demands, and his brow would cloud like a tempest-ridden
sky whenever we approached him on the subject.
Finally, ascertaining that no persuasion could soften
his heart or touch his feelings, a sub-committee was appointed,
to endeavor, if possible, to raise the money by
subscription. Before taking that step, however, we ascertained
beyond all question that Summerfield was the
sole custodian of his dread secret, and that he kept no
written memorial of the formula of his prescription.
He even went so far as to offer us a penal bond that his
secret should perish with him in case we complied with
his demands.</p>

<p>The sub-committee soon commenced work amongst
the wealthiest citizens of San Francisco, and by appealing
to the terrors of a few, and the sympathies of
all, succeeded in raising one half the amount within the
prescribed period. I shall never forget the woe-begone
faces of California Street during the month of October.
The outside world and the newspapers spoke most learnedly
of a money panic&mdash;a pressure in business, and the
disturbances in the New York gold-room. But to the
initiated, there was an easier solution of the enigma.
The pale spectre of Death looked down upon them all,
and pointed with its bony finger to the fiery tomb of
the whole race, already looming up in the distance before
them. Day after day, I could see the dreadful
ravages of this secret horror; doubly terrible, since
they dared not divulge it. Still, do all that we could,
the money could not be obtained. The day preceding
the last one given, Summerfield was summoned before
the committee, and full information given him of the
state of affairs. Obdurate, hard and cruel, he still continued.
Finally, a proposition was started, that an
attempt should be made to raise the other half of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
money in the city of New York. To this proposal Summerfield
ultimately yielded, but with extreme reluctance.
It was agreed in committee, that I should
accompany him thither, and take with me, in my own
possession, evidences of the sums subscribed here; that
a proper appeal should be made to the lending capitalists,
scholars and clergymen of that metropolis, and
that, when the whole amount was raised, it should be
paid over to Summerfield, and a bond taken from him
never to divulge his awful secret to any human being.</p>

<p>With this, he seemed to be satisfied, and left us to
prepare for his going the next morning.</p>

<p>As soon as he left the apartment, the bishop arose,
and deprecated the action that had been taken, and
characterized it as childish and absurd. He declared
that no man was safe one moment whilst "that diabolical
wretch" still lived; that the only security for us
all, was in his immediate extirpation from the face of
the earth, and that no amount of money could seal his
lips, or close his hands. It would be no crime, he said,
to deprive him of the means of assassinating the whole
human family, and that as for himself he was for dooming
him to immediate death.</p>

<p>With a unanimity that was extraordinary, the entire
committee coincided.</p>

<p>A great many plans were proposed, discussed and
rejected, having in view the extermination of Summerfield.
In them all there was the want of that proper
caution which would lull the apprehensions of an enemy;
for should he for an instant suspect treachery, we
knew his nature well enough to be satisfied, that he
would waive all ceremonies and carry his threats into
immediate execution.</p>

<p>It was finally resolved that the trip to New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
should not be abandoned, apparently. But that we
were to start out in accordance with the original programme;
that during the journey, some proper means
should be resorted to by me to carry out the final intentions
of the committee, and that whatever I did would
be sanctioned by them all, and full protection, both in
law and conscience, afforded me in any stage of the proceeding.</p>

<p>Nothing was wanting but my own consent; but this
was difficult to secure.</p>

<p>At the first view, it seemed to be a most horrible and
unwarrantable crime to deprive a fellow-being of life,
under any circumstances; but especially so where, in
meeting his fate, no opportunity was to be afforded him
for preparation or repentance. It was a long time before
I could disassociate, in my mind, the two ideas of
act and intent. My studies had long ago made me perfectly
familiar with the doctrine of the civil law, that
in order to constitute guilt, there must be a union of
action and intention. Taking the property of another
is not theft, unless, as the lawyers term it, there is the
<i>animus furandi</i>. So, in homicide, life may be lawfully
taken in some instances, whilst the deed may be excused
in others. The sheriff hangs the felon, and deprives
him of existence; yet nobody thinks of accusing
the officer of murder. The soldier slays his enemy,
still the act is considered heroical. It does not therefore
follow that human life is too sacred to be taken
away under all circumstances. The point to be considered
was thus narrowed down into one grand inquiry,
whether Summerfield was properly to be regarded as
<i>hostis humani generis</i> the enemy of the human race or
not. If he should justly be so considered, then it
would not only be not a crime to kill him, but an act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
worthy of the highest commendation. Who blamed
McKenzie for hanging Spencer to the yard-arm? Yet in
his case, the lives of only a small ship's crew were in
jeopardy. Who condemned Pompey for exterminating
the pirates from the Adriatic? Yet, in his case, only
a small portion of the Roman Republic was liable to
devastation. Who accuses Charlotte Corday of assassination
for stabbing Murat in his bath? Still, her arm
only saved the lives of a few thousands of revolutionary
Frenchmen. And to come down to our own times, who
heaps accusation upon the heads of Lincoln, Thomas
or Sheridan, or even Grant, though in marching to victory
over a crushed rebellion, they deemed it necessary
to wade through seas of human gore? If society
has the right to defend itself from the assaults of criminals,
who, at best, can only destroy a few of its members,
why should I hesitate when it was apparent that the
destiny of the globe itself hung in the balance? If
Summerfield should live and carry out his threats, the
whole world would feel the shock; his death was the
only path to perfect safety.</p>

<p>I asked the privilege of meditation for one hour, at
the hands of the committee, before I would render a
decision either way. During that recess the above
argumentation occupied my thoughts. The time expired,
and I again presented myself before them. I
did not deem it requisite to state the grounds of my
decision; I briefly signified my assent, and made instant
preparation to carry the plan into execution.</p>

<p>Having passed on the line of the Pacific Railway
more than once, I was perfectly familiar with all of its
windings, gorges and precipices.</p>

<p>I selected Cape Horn as the best adapted to the purpose,
and ... the public knows the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>Having been fully acquitted by two tribunals of the
law, I make this final appeal to my fellow-men throughout
the State, and ask them confidently not to reverse
the judgments already pronounced.</p>

<p>I am conscious of no guilt; I feel no remorse; I need
no repentance. For me justice has no terrors, and conscience
no sting. Let me be judged solely by the
motives which actuated me, and the importance of the
end accomplished, and I shall pass, unscathed, both
temporal and eternal tribunals.</p>

<h3><i>THE DESERTED SCHOOLHOUSE.</i></h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! never may a son of thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0h">Where'er his wand'ring steps incline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0h">Forget the sky which bent above<br /></span>

<p class="cap">There is no silence like that sombre gloom which
sometimes settles down upon the deserted playgrounds,
the unoccupied benches, and the voiceless halls
of an old schoolhouse. But if, in addition to abandonment,
the fingers of decay have been busy with their
work; if the moss has been permitted to grow, and the
mould to gather; if the cobwebs cluster, like clouds, in
all the corners, and the damp dust incrusts the window-panes
like the frosts of a northern winter; if the old well
has caved in, and the little paths through the brushwood
been smothered, and the fences rotted down, and the
stile gone to ruin, then a feeling of utter desolation seizes
upon the soul, which no philosophy can master, no
recollections soothe, and no lapse of time dissipate.</p>

<p>Perchance a lonely wanderer may be observed, traversing
the same scenes which many years ago were trodden
by his ungrown feet, looking pensively at each tree
which sheltered his boyhood, peeping curiously under
the broken benches on which he once sat, and turning
over most carefully with his cane every scrap of old
paper, that strangely enough had survived the winds and
the rains of many winters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Such a schoolhouse now stands near the little village
of Woodville, in the State of North Carolina, and such
a wanderer was I in the autumn of 1852.</p>

<p>Woodville was the scene of my first studies, my earliest
adventures, and my nascent loves. There I was taught
to read and write, to swim and skate, to wrestle and box,
to play marbles and make love. There I fought my first
fight, had the mumps and the measles, stole my first
watermelon, and received my first flogging. And I can
never forget, that within that tattered schoolroom my
young heart first swelled with those budding passions,
whose full development in others has so often changed
the fortunes of the world. There eloquence produced
its first throb, ambition struck its first spark, pride
mounted its first stilts, love felt its first glow. There the
eternal ideas of God and heaven, of patriotism and
country, of love and woman, germinated in my bosom;
and there, too, Poesy sang her first song in my enchanted
ear, lured me far off into the "grand old woods" alone,
sported with the unlanguaged longings of my boyish
heart, and subdued me for the first time with that mysterious
sorrow, whose depths the loftiest intellect cannot
sound, and yet whose wailings mournfully agitate many
a schoolboy's breast.</p>

<p>I reached the village of Woodville one afternoon in
November, after an absence of twenty-two years. Strange
faces greeted me, instead of old, familiar ones; huge
dwellings stood where once I had rambled through cornfields,
groves of young pines covered the old common in
which I had once played at ball, and everything around
presented such an aspect of change, that I almost doubted
my personal identity. Nor was my astonishment diminished
in the slightest degree when the landlord of the
inn announced his name, and I recognized it as once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
belonging to a playmate famous for mischief and fleetness.
Now he appeared bloated, languid, and prematurely
old. Bushy whiskers nearly covered his face, a
horrid gash almost closed up one of his eyes, and an
ominous limp told that he would run no more foot-races
forever.</p>

<p>Unwilling to provoke inquiries by mentioning my own
name, and doubly anxious to see the old schoolhouse,
which I had traveled many miles out of my way to visit,
I took my cane and strolled leisurely along the road that
my feet had hurried over so often in boyhood.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse was situated in a small grove of oaks
and hickories, about half a mile from the village, so as to
be more retired, but at the same time more convenient
for those who resided in the country. My imagination
flew faster than my steps, and under its influence the
half mile dwindled to a mere rod. Passing a turn in
the road, which concealed it until within a few paces, it
suddenly burst upon my vision in all the horrors of its
desolation. A fearful awe took possession of me, and
as I stood beneath the trees I had so often climbed in
years gone by, I could not refrain from looking uneasily
behind me, and treading more softly upon the sacred
leaves, just commencing to wither and fall.</p>

<p>I approached the door with as much reverence as ever
crept Jew or Mussulman, on bended knee and with
downcast eye, to the portals of the Kabbala or Holy
of Holies, and as I reached forth my hand to turn the
latch, I involuntarily paused to listen before I crossed
the threshold.</p>

<p>Ah, manhood! what are all thy triumphs compared to
a schoolboy's palms! What are thy infamies compared
to his disgraces! As head of his class, he carries a
front which a monarch might emulate in vain; as master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of the playground, he wields a sceptre more indisputable
than Czar or Csar ever bore! As a favorite, he provokes
a bitterer hostility than ever greeted a Bute or a
Buckingham; as a coward or traitor, he is loaded with
a contumely beneath which Arnold or Hull would have
sunk forever!</p>

<p>I listened. The pleasant hum of busy voices, the sharp
tones of the master, the mumbled accents of hurried
recitations, all were gone. The gathering shadows of
evening corresponded most fittingly with the deepening
gloom of my recollections, and I abandoned myself to
their guidance, without an effort to control or direct
them.</p>

<p>I stood <i>alone</i> upon the step. Where was he, whose
younger hand always locked in mine, entered that
room and left it so often by my side; that bright-eyed
boy, whose quick wit and genial temper won for him
the affections both of master and scholar; that gentle
spirit that kindled into love, or saddened into tears, as
easily as sunshine dallies with a flower or raindrops
fall from a summer cloud; that brother, whose genius
was my pride, whose courage my admiration, whose soul
my glory; he who faltered not before the walls of Camargo,
when but seven men, out of as many hundred in
his regiment, volunteered to go forward, under the command
of Taylor, to endure all the hardships of a soldier's
life, in a tropical clime, and to brave all the dangers of
a three days' assault upon a fortified city; he who fought
so heroically at Monterey, and escaped death in so many
forms on the battle-field, only to meet it at last as a
victim to contagion, contracted at the bedside of a
friend? Where was he? The swift waters of the Rio
Grande, as they hurry past his unsculptured grave, sing
his requiem, and carry along proudly to the everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
sea the memory of his noble self sacrifice, as the purest
tribute they bear upon their tide!</p>

<p>Such were my thoughts, as I stood pensively upon the
block that served as a step when I was boy, and which
still occupied its ancient position. I noticed that a large
crack extended its whole length, and several shrubs, of
no insignificant size, were growing out of the aperture.
This prepared me for the wreck and ruin of the interior.
The door had been torn from its hinge, and was sustained
in an upright position by a bar or prop on the
inside. This readily gave way on a slight pressure, and
as the old door tumbled headlong upon the floor, it
awoke a thousand confused and muffled echoes, more
startling to me than a clap of the loudest thunder. But
the moment I passed the threshold, the gloom and
terror instantly vanished. I noticed that the back door
was open, and in casting my glance to the upper end of
the room, where the Rev. Mr. Craig once presided in
state, my eyes were greeted by an apparition, that had
evidently become domiciliated in the premises, and
whose appearance revolutionized the whole tenor of my
thoughts. Before me stood one of those venerable-looking
billy-goats, of sedate eye, fantastic beard, and
crumpled horn, the detestation of perfumed belle, and
the dread of mischievous urchin. I had seen a <i>fac-simile</i>
of him many years before, not exactly in the same
place, but hard by in a thicket of pines. I could almost
fancy it to be the ghost of the murdered ancestor, or
some phantom sent to haunt me near the spot of his
execution. I shed no tear, I heaved no sigh, as I trod
the dust-covered floor of the "Woodville Academy,"
but greeted my <i>Alma Mater</i> with a shout of almost boyish
laughter as I approached the spot where the pedagogue
once sat upon his throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>To explain why it was that my feelings underwent a
revulsion so sudden, I must relate the Story of the
Murdered Billy-goat.</p>

<p>Colonel Averitt, a brave soldier in the war of 1812,
retired from the army at the termination of hostilities,
and settled upon a farm adjoining the village of Woodville.
He was rather a queer old gentleman; had a
high Roman nose, and, on muster days, was the general
admiration of all Bertie County. He then officiated
as colonel commandant of militia, and dressed in full
uniform, with a tall, white feather waving most belligerently
from his three-cornered cocked hat. He wore
a sash and sword, and always reviewed the troops on
horseback.</p>

<p>One day, after a statutory review of the militia of the
county, a proposition was started to form a volunteer
company of mounted hussars. A nucleus was soon
obtained, and in less than a week a sufficient number
had enrolled themselves to authorize the Colonel to
order a drill. It happened on a Saturday; the place
selected was an old field near the schoolhouse, and I
need not add that the entire battalion of boys was out
in full force, as spectators of the warlike exercises.
How they got through with the parade, I have forgotten;
but I do remember that the mania for soldiering,
from that day forward, took possession of the school.</p>

<p>The enrollment at first consisted entirely of infantry,
and several weeks elapsed before anybody ventured to
suggest a mounted corps. Late one afternoon, however,
as we were returning homeward, with drums beating
and colors flying, we disturbed a flock of lazy goats,
browsing upon dry grass, and evincing no great dread
for the doughty warriors advancing. Our captain,
whose dignity was highly offended at this utter want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of respect, gave the order to "form column!" "present
arms!" and "charge!" Austrian nor Spaniard, Italian
nor Prussian, before the resistless squadrons of Murat
or Macdonald, ever displayed finer qualities of light
infantry or flying artillery, than did the vanquished
enemy of the "Woodville Cadets" on this memorable
occasion. They were taken entirely by surprise, and,
without offering the least resistance, right-about-faced,
and fled precipitously from the field. Their terrified
bleating mingled fearfully with our shouts of victory;
and when, at the command of our captain. I blew the
signal to halt and rendezvous, our brave fellows magnanimously
gave up the pursuit, and returned from the
chase, bringing with them no less than five full-grown
prisoners, as trophies of victory!</p>

<p>A council of war was immediately called, to determine
in what way we should dispose of our booty.
After much learned discussion, and some warm disputes,
the propositions were narrowed down to two:</p>

<p>Plan the first was, to cut off all the beard of each
prisoner, flog, and release him.</p>

<p>Plan the second, on the contrary, was, to conduct the
prisoners to the playground, treat them kindly, and endeavor
to train them to the bit and saddle, so as to
furnish the officers with what they needed so much,&mdash;war-steeds
for battle, fiery chargers for review.</p>

<p>The vote was finally taken, and plan number two was
adopted by a considerable majority.</p>

<p>Obstacles are never insurmountable to boys and Bonapartes!
Our <i>coup d'etat</i> succeeded quite as well as
that of the 2d of December, and before a week elapsed
the chief officers were all splendidly mounted and fully
equipped.</p>

<p>At this stage of the war against the "bearded races,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the cavalry question was propounded by one of the privates
in Company A. For his part, he declared candidly
that he was tired of marching and countermarching
afoot, and that he saw no good reason why an invasion
of the enemy's country should not at once be undertaken,
to secure animals enough to mount the whole
regiment.</p>

<p>Another council was held, and the resolve unanimously
adopted, to cross the border in full force, on the next
Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the clouds of war began to thicken
in another quarter. Colonel Averitt had been informed
of the <i>coup d'etat</i> related above, and determined to prevent
any further depredations on his flock by a stroke
of masterly generalship, worthy of his prowess in the
late war with Great Britain.</p>

<p>And now it becomes proper to introduce upon the
scene the most important personage in this history, and
the hero of the whole story. I allude, of course, to the
bold, calm, dignified, undaunted and imperturbable
natural guardian of the Colonel's fold&mdash;Billy Goat!</p>

<p>He boasted of a beard longer, whiter, and more venerable
than a high-priest in Masonry; his mane emulated
that of the king of beasts; his horns were as crooked,
and almost as long, as the Cashie River, on whose
banks he was born; his tail might have been selected
by some Spanish hidalgo, as a coat of arms, emblematic
of the pride and hauteur of his family; whilst his
<i>tout ensemble</i> presented that dignity of demeanor, majesty
of carriage, consciousness of superior fortune, and
defiance of all danger, which we may imagine characterized
the elder Napoleon previous to the battle of Waterloo.
But our hero possessed moral qualities quite equal
to his personal traits. He was brave to a fault, combative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to a miracle, and as invincible in battle as he
was belligerent in mood. The sight of a coat-tail invariably
excited his anger, and a red handkerchief nearly
distracted him with rage. Indeed, he had recently
grown so irascible that Colonel Averitt was compelled
to keep him shut up in the fowl-yard, a close prisoner,
to protect him from a justly indignant neighborhood.</p>

<p>Such was the champion that the Colonel now released
and placed at the head of the opposing forces. Saturday
came at last, and the entire morning was devoted
to the construction of the proper number of wooden
bits, twine bridle-reins, leather stirrups and pasteboard
saddles. By twelve o'clock everything was ready, and
the order given to march. We were disappointed in
not finding the enemy at his accustomed haunt, and had
to prolong our march nearly half a mile before we came
up with him. Our scouts, however, soon discovered
him in an old field, lying encamped beneath some young
persimmon bushes, and entirely unconscious of impending
danger. We approached stealthily, according to our
usual plan, and then at a concerted signal rushed headlong
upon the foe. But we had no sooner given the
alarm than our enemies sprang to their feet, and clustered
about a central object, which we immediately recognized,
to our chagrin and terror, as none other than
Billy Goat himself.</p>

<p>The captain, however, was not to be daunted or foiled;
he boldly made a plunge at the champion of our adversaries,
and would have succeeded in seizing him by the
horns, if he had not been unfortunately butted over before
he could reach them. Two or three of our bravest
comrades flew to his assistance, but met with the same
fate before they could rescue him from danger. The
remainder of us drew off a short but prudent distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
from the field of battle, to hold a council of war, and
determine upon a plan of operations. In a few moments
our wounded companions joined us, and entreated
us to close at once upon the foe and surround him.
They declared they were not afraid to beard the lion in
his den, and that being butted heels over head two or
three times but whetted their courage, and incited them
to deeds of loftier daring. Their eloquence, however,
was more admired than their prudence, and a large majority
of the council decided that "it was inopportune,
without other munitions of war than those we had upon
the field, to risk a general engagement." It was agreed,
however, <i>nem. con.</i>, that on the next Saturday we would
provide ourselves with ropes and fishing-poles, and such
other arms as might prove advantageous, and proceed
to surround and noose our most formidable enemy, overpower
him by the force of numbers, and take him prisoner
at all hazards. Having fully determined upon this
plan of attack, we hoisted our flag once more, ordered
the drum to beat Yankee Doodle, and retreated in most
excellent order from the field&mdash;our foe not venturing to
pursue us.</p>

<p>The week wore slowly and uneasily away. The clouds
of war were gathering rapidly, and the low roll of distant
thunder announced that a battle storm of no ordinary
importance was near at hand. Colonel Averitt, by
some traitorous trick of war, had heard of our former defeat,
and publicly taunted our commander with his failure.
Indeed, more than one of the villagers had heard
of the disastrous result of the campaign, and sent impertinent
messages to those who had been wounded in the
encounter. Two or three of the young ladies, also, in
the girls' department, had been inoculated with the <i>fun</i>
(as it was absurdly denominated), and a leather medal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
was pinned most provokingly to the short jacket of the
captain by one of those hoydenish Amazons.</p>

<p>All these events served to whet the courage of our
men, and strange as it may appear, to embitter our hostility
to our victorious foe. Some of the officers proceeded
so far as to threaten Colonel Averitt himself,
and at one time, I am confident, he stood in almost as
much danger as the protector of his flock.</p>

<p>Saturday came at last, and at the first blast of the
bugle, we formed into line, and advanced with great
alacrity into the enemy's country. After marching half
an hour, our scouts hastily returned, with the information
that the enemy was drawn up, in full force, near
the scene of the Persimmon bush battle. We advanced
courageously to within speaking distance, and then
halted to breathe the troops and prepare for the engagement.
We surveyed our enemies with attention,
but without alarm. There they stood right before us!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Firm paced and slow, a horrid front they form;<br /></span>
<span class="i0h">Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our preparations were soon made, and at the command
of the captain, we separated into single files, one
half making a <i>detour</i> to the right, and the other to the
left, so as to encircle the foe. Our instructions were to
spare all non-combatants, to pass by as unworthy of
notice all minor foes, and to make a simultaneous rush
upon the proud champion of our adversaries.</p>

<p>By this masterly man&oelig;uvre it was supposed we should
be enabled to escape unharmed, or at any rate without
many serious casualties. But as it afterward appeared,
we did not sufficiently estimate the strength and activity
of our enemy.</p>

<p>After this preparatory man&oelig;uvre had been successfully
accomplished, our captain gave the order to
"charge!" in a stentorian voice, and at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
rushed forward most gallantly at the head of the squadron.
The post of honor is generally the post of danger
also, and so it proved on this occasion; for before
the captain could grapple with the foe, Billy Goat rose
suddenly on his hinder legs, and uttering a loud note
of defiance, dashed with lightning speed at the breast
of our commander, and at a single blow laid him prostrate
on the field. Then wheeling quickly, ere any of
his assailants could attack his rear flank, he performed
the same exploit upon the first and second lieutenants,
and made an unsuccessful pass at the standard-bearer,
who eluded the danger by a scientific retreat. At this
moment, when the fortunes of the day hung, as it were,
on a single hair, our drummer, who enjoyed the <i>sobriquet</i>
of "Weasel," advanced slowly but chivalrously
upon the foe.</p>

<p>As the hosts of Israel and Gath paused upon the field
of Elah, and awaited with fear and trembling the issue
of the single-handed contest between David and Goliah;
as Roman and Sabine stood back and reposed on their
arms, whilst Horatio and Curiatii fought for the destiny
of Rome and the mastery of the world, so the "Woodville
Cadets" halted in their tracks on this memorable
day, and all aghast with awe and admiration, watched
the progress of the terrible duello between "Weasel,"
the drummer boy, and Billy Goat, the hero of the battle
of the Persimmon bush.</p>

<p>The drummer first disengaged himself from the incumbrance
of his martial music, then threw his hat
fiercely upon the ground, and warily and circumspectly
approached his foe. Nor was that foe unprepared, for
rearing as usual on his nether extremities, he bleated
out a long note of contempt and defiance, and dashed
suddenly upon the "Weasel."</p>

<p>Instead of waiting to receive the force of the blow upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
his breast or brow, the drummer wheeled right-about
face, and falling suddenly upon all fours with most
surprising dexterity, presented a less vulnerable part of
his body to his antagonist, who, being under full headway,
was compelled to accept the substituted buttress,
and immediately planted there a herculean thump. I
need not say that the drummer was hurled many feet
heels over head, by this disastrous blow; but he had
obtained the very advantage he desired to secure, and
springing upon his feet he leaped quicker than lightning
upon the back of his foe, and in spite of every
effort to dislodge him, sat there in security and triumph!</p>

<p>With a loud huzza, the main body of the "Cadets"
now rushed forward, and after a feeble resistance, succeeded
in overpowering the champion of our foes.</p>

<p>As a matter of precaution, we blindfolded him with
several handkerchiefs, and led him away in as much
state as the Emperor Aurelian displayed when he carried
Zenobia to Rome, a prisoner at his chariot-wheels.</p>

<p>The fate of the vanquished Billy Goat is soon related.
A council of war decided that he should be taken into
a dense pine thicket, there suspended head downwards,
and thrashed <i>ad libitum</i>, by the whole army.</p>

<p>The sentence was carried into execution immediately;
and though he was cut down and released after our
vengeance was satisfied, I yet owe it to truth and history
to declare, that before a week elapsed, he died of
a broken heart, and was buried by Colonel Averitt with
all the honors of war.</p>

<p>If it be any satisfaction to the curious inquirer, I may
add in conclusion, that the Rev. Mr. Craig avenged his
<i>manes</i>, by wearing out a chinquapin apiece on the backs
of "Weasel," the captain and officers, and immediately
afterward disbanded the whole army.</p>

<h2>V.</h2>

<h3><i>PHASES IN THE LIFE OF JOHN POLLEXFEN.</i></h3>


<p class="secsc">PHASE THE FIRST.</p>

<p class="cap">There are but three persons now living who can
truthfully answer the question, "How did John
Pollexfen, the photographer, make his fortune?"</p>

<p>No confidence will be violated, now that he is dead,
and his heirs residents of a foreign country, if I relate
the story of that singular man, whose rapid accumulation
of wealth astonished the whole circle of his
acquaintance.</p>

<p>Returning from the old man's funeral a few days
since, the subject of Pollexfen's discoveries became
the topic of conversation; and my companions in the
same carriage, aware that, as his attorney and confidential
friend, I knew more of the details of his business
than any one else, extorted from me a promise that at
the first leisure moment I would relate, in print, the
secret of that curious invention by which the photographic
art was so largely enriched, and himself elevated
at once to the acme of opulence and renown.</p>

<p>Few persons who were residents of the city of San
Francisco at an early day, will fail to remember the
site of the humble gallery in which Pollexfen laid
the foundations of his fame. It was situated on Merchant
Street, about midway between Kearny and Montgomery
Streets, in an old wooden building; the ground
being occupied at present by the solid brick structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of Thomas R. Bolton. It fed the flames of the great
May fire of 1851, was rebuilt, but again consumed in
December, 1853. It was during the fall of the latter
year that the principal event took place which is to constitute
the most prominent feature of my narrative.</p>

<p>I am aware that the facts will be discredited by many,
and doubted at first by all; but I beg to premise, at the
outset, that because they are uncommon, by no means
proves that they are untrue. Besides, should the question
ever become a judicial one, I hold in my hands
such <i>written proofs</i>, signed by the parties most deeply
implicated, as will at once terminate both doubt and
litigation. Of this, however, I have at present no apprehensions;
for Lucile and her husband are both too
honorable to assail the reputation of the dead, and too
rich themselves to attempt to pillage the living.</p>

<p>As it is my wish to be distinctly understood, and at
the same time to be exculpated from all blame for the
part I myself acted in the drama, the story must commence
with my first acquaintance with Mademoiselle
Lucile Marmont.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1851, I embarked at New York for
Panama, or rather Chagres, on board the steamship
"Ohio," Captain Schenck, on my way to the then distant
coast of California, attracted hither by the universal
desire to accumulate a rapid fortune, and return at the
earliest practicable period to my home, on the Atlantic
seaboard.</p>

<p>There were many hundred such passengers on the
same ship. But little sociability prevailed, until after
the steamer left Havana, where it was then the custom
to touch on the "outward bound," to obtain a fresh
supply of fuel and provisions. We were detained longer
than customary at Havana, and most of the passengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
embraced the opportunity to visit the Bishop's Garden
and the tomb of Columbus.</p>

<p>One morning, somewhat earlier than usual, I was
standing outside the railing which incloses the monument
of the great discoverer, and had just transcribed
in my note-book the following epitaph:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O! Restos y Imagen<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Del Grande Colon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mil siglos durad guardados<br /></span>
<span class="i1">En lare Urna,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Y en la Remembranza<br /></span>
<span class="i1">De Nuestra Nacion,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>when I was suddenly interrupted by a loud scream
directly behind me. On turning, I beheld a young
lady whom I had seen but once before on the steamer,
leaning over the prostrate form of an elderly female,
and applying such restoratives as were at hand to resuscitate
her, for she had fainted. Seeing me, the
daughter exclaimed, "<i>Oh, Monsieur! y-a-t-il un medecin
ici?</i>" I hastened to the side of the mother, and was
about to lift her from the pavement, when M. Marmont
himself entered the cathedral. I assisted him in placing
his wife in a <i>volante</i> then passing, and she was safely
conveyed to the hotel.</p>

<p>Having myself some knowledge of both French and
Spanish, and able to converse in either tongue, Lucile
Marmont, then sixteen years of age, and I, from that
time forward, became close and confidential friends.</p>

<p>The steamer sailed the next day, and in due time
anchored off the roadstead of Chagres. But Mme.
Marmont, in the last stages of consumption when she
embarked at New York, continued extremely ill until
we passed Point Concepcion, on this coast, when she
suddenly expired from an attack of hemorrhage of the
lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>She was buried at sea; and never can I forget the
unutterable anguish of poor Lucile, as her mother's
body splashed into the cold blue waters of the Pacific.</p>

<p>There she stood, holding on to the railing, paler than
monumental marble, motionless as a statue, rigid as a
corpse. The whole scene around her seemed unperceived.
Her eyes gazed upon vacancy; her head was
thrust slightly forward, and her disheveled tresses, black
as Plutonian night, fell neglected about her shoulders.</p>

<p>Captain Watkins, then commanding the "Panama"&mdash;whom,
may God bless&mdash;wept like a child; and his
manly voice, that never quailed in the dread presence
of the lightning or the hurricane, broke, chokingly, as
he attempted to finish the burial rite, and died away in
agitated sobs.</p>

<p>One by one the passengers left the spot, consecrated
to the grief of that only child&mdash;now more than orphaned
by her irreparable loss. Lifting my eyes, at last, none
save the daughter and her father stood before me.
Charmed to the spot was I, by a spell that seemed irresistible.
Scarcely able to move a muscle, there I remained,
speechless and overpowered. Finally the father
spoke, and then Lucile fell headlong into his arms. He
bore her into his state-room, where the ship's surgeon
was summoned, and where he continued his ministrations
until we reached this port.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to add, that I attended them
ashore, and saw them safely and commodiously lodged
at the old Parker House, before I once thought of my
own accommodations.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, and months, too, stole gradually away,
before I saw anything more of the bereaved and mourning
child. One day, however, as I was lolling carelessly
in my office, after business hours (and that meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
just at dark in those early times), Lucile hastily entered.
I was startled to see her; for upon her visage I thought
I beheld the same stolid spell of agony that some months
before had transfixed my very soul. Before I had time
to recover myself, or ask her to be seated, she approached
closer, and said in a half whisper, "Oh, sir,
come with me home."</p>

<p>On our way she explained that her father was lying
dangerously ill, and that she knew no physician to whom
she could apply, and in whose skill she could place confidence.
I at once recommended Dr. H. M. White
(since dead), well knowing not only his great success,
but equally cognizant of that universal charity that rendered
him afterwards no less beloved than illustrious.
Without a moment's hesitation, the Doctor seized his
hat, and hastened along with us, to the wretched abode
of the sick, and, as it afterwards proved, the palsied
father. The disease was pronounced apoplexy, and recovery
doubtful. Still, there was hope. Whilst we
were seated around the bedside, a tall, emaciated, feeble,
but very handsome young man entered, and staggered
to a seat. He was coarsely and meanly clad; but there
was something about him that not only betokened the
gentleman, but the well-bred and accomplished scholar.
As he seated himself, he exchanged a glance with Lucile,
and in that silent look I read the future history of both
their lives. On lifting my eyes toward hers, the pallor
fled for an instant from her cheek, and a traitor blush
flashed its crimson confession across her features.</p>

<p>The patient was copiously bled from an artery in the
temple, and gradually recovered his consciousness, but
on attempting to speak we ascertained that partial paralysis
had resulted from the fit.</p>

<p>As I rose, with the Doctor, to leave, Lucile beckoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
me to remain, and approaching me more closely, whispered
in French, "Stay, and I will tell you all." The
main points of her story, though deeply interesting to
me, at that time, were so greatly eclipsed by subsequent
events, that they are scarcely worthy of narration.
Indeed, I shall not attempt to detail them here fully, but
will content myself with stating, in few words, only such
events as bear directly upon the fortunes of John
Pollexfen.</p>

<p>As intimated above, Lucile was an only child. She
was born in Dauphiny, a province of France, and immigrated
to America during the disastrous year 1848. Her
father was exiled, and his estates seized by the officers
of the government, on account of his political tenets.
The family embarked at Marseilles, with just sufficient
ready money to pay their passage to New York, and
support them for a few months after their arrival. It soon
became apparent that want, and perhaps starvation,
were in store, unless some means of obtaining a livelihood
could be devised. The sole expedient was music,
of which M. Marmont was a proficient, and to this
resource he at once applied himself most industriously.
He had accumulated a sufficient sum to pay his expenses
to this coast, up to the beginning of 1851, and took
passage for San Francisco, as we have already seen, in
the spring of that year.</p>

<p>Reaching here, he became more embarrassed every
day, unacquainted as he was with the language, and still
less with the wild life into which he was so suddenly
plunged. Whilst poverty was pinching his body, grief
for the loss of his wife was torturing his soul. Silent,
sad, almost morose to others, his only delight was in his
child. Apprehensions for her fate, in case of accident
to himself, embittered his existence, and hastened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
catastrophe above related. Desirous of placing her in a
situation in which she could earn a livelihood, independent
of his own precarious exertions, he taught her
drawing and painting, and had just succeeded in obtaining
for her the employment of coloring photographs at
Pollexfen's gallery the very day he was seized with his
fatal disorder.</p>

<p>Some weeks previous to this, Charles Courtland, the
young man before mentioned, became an inmate of his
house under the following circumstances:</p>

<p>One evening, after the performances at the Jenny Lind
Theatre (where M. Marmont was employed) were over,
and consequently very late, whilst he was pursuing his
lonely way homewards he accidentally stumbled over an
impediment in his path. He at once recognized it as a
human body, and being near home, he lifted the senseless
form into his house. A severe contusion behind the
ear had been the cause of the young man's misfortune,
and his robbery had been successfully accomplished
whilst lying in a state of insensibility.</p>

<p>His recovery was extremely slow, and though watched
by the brightest pair of eyes that ever shot their dangerous
glances into a human soul, Courtland had not
fully recovered his strength up to the time that I made
his acquaintance.</p>

<p>He was a Virginian by birth; had spent two years in
the mines on Feather River, and having accumulated a
considerable sum of money, came to San Francisco to
purchase a small stock of goods, with which he intended
to open a store at Bidwell's Bar. His robbery
frustrated all these golden dreams, and his capture by
Lucile Marmont completed his financial ruin.</p>

<p>Here terminates the first phase in the history of John
Pollexfen.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p class="secsc">PHASE THE SECOND.</p>

<p>"Useless! useless! all useless!" exclaimed John Pollexfen,
as he dashed a glass negative, which he had most
elaborately prepared, into the slop-bucket. "Go, sleep
with your predecessors." After a moment's silence, he
again spoke: "But I know <i>it exists</i>. Nature has the
secret locked up securely, as she thinks, but I'll tear it
from her. Doesn't the eye see? Is not the retina impressible
to the faintest gleam of light? What telegraphs
to my soul the colors of the rainbow? Nothing
but the eye, the human eye. And shall John Pollexfen
be told, after he has lived half a century, that the compacted
humors of this little organ can do more than his
whole laboratory? By heaven! I'll wrest the secret
from the labyrinth of nature, or pluck my own eyes
from their sockets."</p>

<p>Thus soliloquized John Pollexfen, a few days after
the events narrated in the last chapter.</p>

<p>He was seated at a table, in a darkened chamber, with
a light burning, though in the middle of the day, and
his countenance bore an unmistakable expression of
disappointment, mingled with disgust, at the failure of
his last experiment. He was evidently in an ill-humor,
and seemed puzzled what to do next. Just then a light
tap came at the door, and in reply to an invitation to
enter, the pale, delicate features of Lucile Marmont
appeared at the threshold.</p>

<p>"Oh! is it you, my child?" said the photographer,
rising. "Let me see your touches." After surveying
the painted photographs a moment, he broke out into a
sort of artistic glee: "Beautiful! beautiful! an adept,
quite an adept! Who taught you? Come, have no secrets
from me; I'm an old man, and may be of service
to you yet. What city artist gave you the cue?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Before relating any more of the conversation, it becomes
necessary to paint John Pollexfen as he was.
Methinks I can see his tall, rawboned, angular form
before me, even now, as I write these lines. There he
stands, Scotch all over, from head to foot. It was
whispered about in early times&mdash;for really no one knew
much about his previous career&mdash;that John Pollexfen
had been a famous sea captain; that he had sailed
around the world many times; had visited the coast of
Africa under suspicious circumstances, and finally found
his way to California from the then unpopular region of
Australia. Without pausing to trace these rumors further,
it must be admitted that there was something in
the appearance of the man sufficiently repulsive, at first
sight, to give them currency. He had a large bushy
head, profusely furnished with hair almost brickdust
in color, and growing down upon a broad, low forehead,
indicative of great mathematical and constructive
power. His brows were long and shaggy, and overhung
a restless, deep-set, cold, gray eye, that met the
fiercest glance unquailingly, and seemed possessed of
that magnetic power which dazzles, reads and confounds
whatsoever it looks upon. There was no escape from
its inquisitive glitter. It sounded the very depths of the
soul it thought proper to search. Whilst gazing at you,
instinct felt the glance before your own eye was lifted
so as to encounter his. There was no human weakness
in its expression. It was as pitiless as the gleam of
the lightning. But you felt no less that high intelligence
flashed from its depths. Courage, you knew,
was there; and true bravery is akin to all the nobler virtues.
This man, you at once said, may be cold, but it
is impossible for him to be unjust, deceitful or ungenerous.
He might, like Shylock, insist on a <i>right</i>, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
matter how vindictive, but he would never forge a
claim, no matter how insignificant. He might crush,
like Csar, but he could never plot like Catiline. In
addition to all this, it required but slight knowledge of
physiognomy to perceive that his stern nature was tinctured
with genuine enthusiasm. Earnestness beamed
forth in every feature. His soul was as sincere as it
was unbending. He could not trifle, even with the
most inconsiderable subject. Laughter he abhorred.
He could smile, but there was little contagion in his
pleasantry. It surprised more than it pleased you.
Blended with this deep, scrutinizing, earnest and enthusiastic
nature, there was an indefinable something,
shading the whole character&mdash;it might have been early
sorrow, or loss of fortune, or baffled ambition, or
unrequited love. Still, it shone forth patent to the experienced
eye, enigmatical, mysterious, sombre. There
was danger, also, in it, and many, who knew him best,
attributed his eccentricity to a softened phase of
insanity.</p>

<p>But the most marked practical trait of Pollexfen's
character was his enthusiasm for his art. He studied
its history, from the humble hints of Nipce to the
glorious triumphs of Farquer, Bingham, and Bradley,
with all the soul-engrossing fidelity of a child, and spent
many a midnight hour in striving to rival or surpass
them. It was always a subject of astonishment with
me, until after his death, how it happened that a rough,
athletic seaman, as people declared he was originally,
should become so intensely absorbed in a science requiring
delicacy of taste, and skill in manipulation
rather than power of muscle, in its practical application.
But after carefully examining the papers tied up in the
same package with his last will and testament, I ceased
to wonder, and sought no further for an explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>Most prominent amongst these carefully preserved
documents was an old diploma, granted by the University
of Edinburgh, in the year 1821, to "John Pollexfen,
Gent., of Hallicardin, Perthshire," constituting
him Doctor of Medicine. On the back of the diploma,
written in a round, clear hand, I found indorsed as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fifteen years of my life have I lost by professing modern
quackery. Medicine is not a science, properly so called.
It is at most but an art. He best succeeds who creates his
own system. Each generation adopts its peculiar manual:
Sangrado to-day; Thomson to-morrow; Hahnemann the day
after. Surgery advances; physic is stationary. But chemistry,
glorious chemistry, is a science. Born amid dissolving
ruins, and cradled upon rollers of fire, her step is onward.
At her side, as an humble menial, henceforth shall be found</p>

<p class="sig">J<span class="smsmcap">ohn</span> P<span class="smsmcap">ollexfen.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The indorsement bore no date, but it must have been
written long before his immigration to California.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed with the interview between the
photographer and his employee. Repeating the question
quickly, "Who gave you the cue?" demanded Pollexfen.</p>

<p>"My father taught me drawing and painting, but my
own taste suggested the coloring."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me, really, that you taught
yourself, Mlle. Marmont?" and as he said this, the cold,
gray eye lit up with unwonted brilliancy.</p>

<p>"What I say is true," replied the girl, and elevating
her own lustrous eyes, they encountered his own, with
a glance quite as steady.</p>

<p>"Let us go into the sunlight, and examine the tints
more fully;" and leading the way they emerged into the
sitting-room where customers were in the habit of
awaiting the artist's pleasure.</p>

<p>Here the pictures were again closely scrutinized, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
far more accurately than before; and after fully satisfying
his curiosity on the score of the originality of the
penciling, approached Lucile very closely, and darting
his wonderful glance into the depths of her own eyes,
said, after a moment's pause, "You have glorious eyes."</p>

<p>Lucile was about to protest, in a hurried way, against
such adulation, when he continued: "Nay, nay, do not
deny it. Your eyes are the most fathomless orbs that
ever I beheld&mdash;large, too, and lustrous&mdash;the very eyes
I have been searching for these five years past. A
judge of color; a rare judge of color! How is your
father to-day, my child?"</p>

<p>The tone of voice in which this last remark was made
had in it more of the curious than the tender. It
seemed to have been propounded more as a matter of
business than of feeling. Still, Lucile replied respectfully,
"Oh! worse, sir; a great deal worse. Doctor
White declares that it is impossible for him to recover,
and that he cannot live much longer."</p>

<p>"Not live?" replied Pollexfen, "not live?" Then,
as if musing, he solemnly added, "When your father
is dead, Lucile, come to me, and I will make your
fortune. That is, if you follow my advice, and place
yourself exclusively under my instructions. Nay, but
you shall earn it yourself. See!" he exclaimed, and
producing a bank deposit-book from his pocket, "See!
here have I seven thousand five hundred dollars in
bank, and I would gladly exchange it for one of your
eyes."</p>

<p>Astonishment overwhelmed the girl, and she could
make no immediate reply; and before she had sufficiently
recovered her self-possession to speak, the
photographer hastily added, "Don't wonder; farewell,
now. Remember what I have said&mdash;seven thousand
five hundred dollars just for one eye!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>Lucile was glad to escape, without uttering a syllable.
Pursuing her way homewards, she pondered deeply
over the singular remark with which Pollexfen closed
the conversation, and half muttering, said to herself,
"Can he be in earnest? or is it simply the odd way in
which an eccentric man pays a compliment?" But long
before she could solve the enigma, other thoughts, far
more engrossing, took sole possession of her mind.</p>

<p>She fully realized her situation&mdash;a dying father, and
a sick lover, both dependent in a great measure upon
her exertions, and she herself not yet past her seventeenth
year.</p>

<p>On reaching home she found the door wide open, and
Courtland standing in the entrance, evidently awaiting
her arrival. As she approached, their eyes met, and a
glance told her that all was over.</p>

<p>"Dead!" softly whispered Courtland.</p>

<p>A stifled sob was all that broke from the lips of the
child, as she fell lifeless into the arms of her lover.</p>

<p>I pass over the mournful circumstances attending the
funeral of the exiled Frenchman. He was borne to his
grave by a select few of his countrymen, whose acquaintance
he had made during his short residence in this city.
Like thousands of others, who have perished in our
midst, he died, and "left no sign." The newspapers
published the item the next morning, and before the
sun had set upon his funeral rites the poor man was
forgotten by all except the immediate persons connected
with this narrative.</p>

<p>To one of them, at least, his death was not only an
important event, but it formed a great epoch in her
history.</p>

<p>Lucile was transformed, in a moment of time, from
a helpless, confiding, affectionate girl, into a full-grown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
self-dependent, imperious woman. Such revolutions, I
know, are rare in everyday life, and but seldom occur;
in fact, they never happen except in those rare instances
where nature has stamped a character with the elements
of inborn originality and force, which accident, or
sudden revulsion, develops at once into full maturity.
To such a soul, death of an only parent operates like
the summer solstice upon the whiter snow of Siberia.
It melts away the weakness and credulity of childhood
almost miraculously, and exhibits, with the suddenness
of an apparition, the secret and hitherto unknown traits
that will forever afterwards distinguish the individual.
The explanation of this curious moral phenomenon consists
simply in bringing to the surface what already was
in existence below; not in the instantaneous creation of
new elements of character. The tissues were already
there; circumstance hardens them into bone. Thus we
sometimes behold the same marvel produced by the marriage
of some characterless girl, whom we perhaps had
known from infancy, and whose individuality we had
associated with cake, or crinoline&mdash;a gay humming-bird
of social life, so light and frivolous and unstable, that,
as she flitted across our pathway, we scarcely deigned
her the compliment of a thought. Yet a week or a
month after her nuptials, we meet the self-same warbler,
not as of old, beneath the paternal roof, but under her
own "vine and fig-tree," and in astonishment we ask
ourselves, "Can this be the bread-and-butter Miss we
passed by with the insolence of a sneer, a short time
ago?" Behold her now! On her brow sits womanhood.
Upon her features beam out palpably traits of great
force and originality. She moves with the majesty of
a queen, and astounds us by taking a leading part in the
discussion of questions of which we did not deem she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
ever dreamed. What a transformation is here! Has
nature proven false to herself? Is this a miracle? Are
all her laws suspended, that she might transform, in an
instant, a puling trifler into a perfect woman? Not so,
oh! doubter. Not nature is false, but you are yourself
ignorant of her laws. Study Shakspeare; see Gloster
woo, and win, the defiant, revengeful and embittered
Lady Anne, and confess in your humility that it is far
more probable that you should err, than that Shakspeare
should be mistaken.</p>

<p>Not many days after the death of M. Marmont, it
was agreed by all the friends of Lucile, that the kind
offer extended to her by Pollexfen should be accepted,
and that she should become domiciliated in his household.
He was unmarried, it is true, but still he kept
up an establishment. His housekeeper was a dear old
lady, Scotch, like her master, but a direct contrast in
every trait of her character. Her duties were not many,
nor burdensome. Her time was chiefly occupied in
family matters&mdash;cooking, washing, and feeding the pets&mdash;so
that it was but seldom she made her appearance
in any other apartment than those entirely beneath her
own supervision.</p>

<p>The photographer had an assistant in his business, a
Chinaman; and upon him devolved the task of caring
for the outer offices.</p>

<p>Courtland, with a small stock of money, and still
smaller modicum of health, left at once for Bidwell's
Bar, where he thought of trying his fortune once more
at mining, and where he was well and most cordially
known.</p>

<p>It now only remained to accompany Lucile to her new
home, to see her safely ensconced in her new quarters,
to speak a flattering word in her favor to Pollexfen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
then, to bid her farewell, perhaps forever. All this was
duly accomplished, and with good-bye on my lips, and
a sorrowful sympathy in my heart, I turned away from
the closing door of the photographer, and wended my
way homewards.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Marmont was met at the threshold by
Martha McClintock, the housekeeper, and ushered at
once into the inner apartment, situated in the rear of
the gallery.</p>

<p>After removing her veil and cloak, she threw herself
into an arm-chair, and shading her eyes with both
her hands, fell into a deep reverie. She had been in
that attitude but a few moments, when a large Maltese
cat leaped boldly into her lap, and began to court
familiarity by purring and playing, as with an old acquaintance.
Lucile cast a casual glance at the animal,
and noticed immediately that it had but <i>one eye!</i> Expressing
no astonishment, but feeling a great deal, she
cast her eyes cautiously around the apartment.</p>

<p>Near the window hung a large tin cage, containing a
blue African parrot, with crimson-tipped shoulders and
tail. At the foot of the sofa, a silken-haired spaniel was
quietly sleeping, whilst, outside the window, a bright
little canary was making the air melodious with its
happy warbling. A noise in an adjoining room aroused
the dog, and set it barking. As it lifted its glossy ears
and turned its graceful head toward Lucile, her surprise
was enhanced in the greatest degree, by perceiving that
it, too, had lost an eye. Rising, she approached the
window, impelled by a curiosity that seemed irresistible.
Peering into the cage, she coaxed the lazy parrot
to look at her, and her amazement was boundless when
she observed that the poor bird was marred in the same
mournful manner. Martha witnessed her astonishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and indulged in a low laugh, but said nothing. At this
moment Pollexfen himself entered the apartment, and
with his appearance must terminate the second phase
of his history.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />
<p class="secsc">PHASE THE THIRD.</p>

<p>"Come and sit by me, Mademoiselle Marmont," said
Pollexfen, advancing at the same time to the sofa, and
politely making way for the young lady, who followed
almost mechanically. "You must not believe me as bad
as I may seem at first sight, for we all have redeeming
qualities, if the world would do us the justice to seek for
them as industriously as for our faults."</p>

<p>"I am very well able to believe that," replied Lucile,
"for my dear father instructed me to act upon the maxim,
that good predominates over evil, even in this life; and
I feel sure that I need fear no harm beneath the roof of
the only real benefactor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! we will not bandy compliments at our first
sitting; they are the prelude amongst men, to hypocrisy
first, and wrong afterwards. May I so far transgress the
rules of common politeness as to ask your age? Not from
idle curiosity, I can assure you."</p>

<p>"At my next birthday," said Lucile, "I shall attain
the age of seventeen years."</p>

<p>"And when may that be?" pursued her interlocutor.
"I had hoped you were older, by a year."</p>

<p>"My birthday is the 18th of November, and really,
sir, I am curious to know why you feel any disappointment
that I am not older."</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing of any great consequence; only this,
that by the laws of California, on reaching the age of
eighteen you become the sole mistress of yourself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>"I greatly fear," timidly added the girl, "that I shall
have to anticipate the law, and assume that responsibility
at once."</p>

<p>"But you can only contract through a guardian before
that era in your life; and in the agreement <i>between us,
that is to be</i>, no third person shall intermeddle. But we
will not now speak of that. You must consider yourself
my equal here; there must be no secrets to hide from
each other; no suspicions engendered. We are both
artists. Confidence is the only path to mutual improvement.
My business is large, but my ambition to excel
greater, far. Listen to me, child!" and suddenly rising,
so as to confront Lucile, he darted one of those magnetic
glances into the very fortress of her soul, which we have
before attempted to describe, and added, in an altered
tone of voice, "The sun's raybrush paints the rainbow
upon the evanescent cloud, and photographs an iris in
the skies. The human eye catches the picture ere it
fades, and transfers it with all its beauteous tints to that
prepared albumen, the retina. The soul sees it there,
and rejoices at the splendid spectacle. Shall insensate
nature outpaint the godlike mind? Can she leave her
brightest colors on the dark <i>collodion</i> of a thunder-cloud,
and I not transfer the blush of a rose, or the vermilion
of a dahlia, to my <i>Rivi</i> or <i>Saxe?</i> No! no! I'll not believe
it. Let us work together, girl; we'll lead the age we
live in. My name shall rival Titian's, and you shall
yet see me snatch the colors of the dying dolphin from
decay, and bid them live forever."</p>

<p>And so saying, he turned with a suddenness that
startled his pupil, and strode hastily out of the apartment.</p>

<p>Unaccustomed, as Lucile had been from her very birth,
to brusque manners, like those of the photographer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
their grotesqueness impressed her with an indefinable
relish for such awkward sincerity, and whetted her
appetite to see more of the man whose enthusiasm always
got the better of his politeness.</p>

<p>"He is no Frenchman," thought the girl, "but I like
him none the less. He has been very, very kind to me,
and I am at this moment dependent upon him for my
daily bread." Then, changing the direction of her
thoughts, they recurred to the subject-matter of Pollexfen's
discourse. "Here," thought she, "lies the clue
to the labyrinth. If insane, his madness is a noble one;
for he would link his name with the progress of his art.
He seeks to do away with the necessity of such poor
creatures as myself, as adjuncts to photography. Nature,
he thinks, should lay on the coloring, not man&mdash;the Sun
himself should paint, not the human hand." And with
these, and kindred thoughts, she opened her escritoire,
and taking out her pencils sat down to the performance
of her daily labor.</p>

<p>Oh, blessed curse of Adam's posterity, healthful
toil, all hail! Offspring of sin and shame&mdash;still heaven's
best gift to man. Oh, wondrous miracle of Providence!
divinest alchemy of celestial science! by which the
chastisement of the progenitor transforms itself into a
priceless blessing upon the offspring! None but God
himself could transmute the sweat of the face into a
panacea for the soul. How many myriads have been
cured by toil of the heart's sickness and the body's
infirmities! The clink of the hammer drowns, in its
music, the lamentations of pain and the sighs of sorrow.
Even the distinctions of rank and wealth and talents
are all forgotten, and the inequalities of stepdame Fortune
all forgiven, whilst the busy whirls of industry are
bearing us onward to our goal. No condition in life is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
so much to be envied as his who is too busy to indulge
in reverie. Health is his companion, happiness his
friend. Ills flee from his presence as night-birds from
the streaking of the dawn. Pale Melancholy, and her
sister Insanity, never invade his dominions; for Mirth
stands sentinel at the border, and Innocence commands
the garrison of his soul.</p>

<p>Henceforth let no man war against fate whose lot has
been cast in that happy medium, equidistant from the
lethargic indolence of superabundant wealth, and the
abject paralysis of straitened poverty. Let them toil
on, and remember that God is a worker, and strews
infinity with revolving worlds! Should he forget, in a
moment of grief or triumph, of gladness or desolation,
that being born to toil, in labor only shall he find contentment,
let him ask of the rivers why they never rest,
of the sunbeams why they never pause. Yea, of the
great globe itself, why it travels on forever in the golden
pathway of the ecliptic, and nature, from her thousand
voices, will respond: Motion is life, inertia is death;
action is health, stagnation is sickness; toil is glory,
torpor is disgrace!</p>

<p>I cannot say that thoughts as profound as these found
their way into the mind of Lucile, as she plied her task,
but nature vindicated her own laws in her case, as she
will always do, if left entirely to herself.</p>

<p>As day after day and week after week rolled by, a
softened sorrow, akin only to grief&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As the mist resembles the rain"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>took the place of the poignant woe which had overwhelmed
her at first, and time laid a gentle hand upon
her afflictions. Gradually, too, she became attached to
her art, and made such rapid strides towards proficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
that Pollexfen ceased, finally, to give any instruction, or
offer any hints as to the manner in which she ought to
paint. Thus her own taste became her only guide; and
before six months had elapsed after the death of her
father, the pictures of Pollexfen became celebrated
throughout the city and state, for the correctness of
their coloring and the extraordinary delicacy of their
finish. His gallery was daily thronged with the wealth,
beauty and fashion of the great metropolis, and the hue
of his business assumed the coloring of success.</p>

<p>But his soul was the slave of a single thought. Turmoil
brooded there, like darkness over chaos ere the
light pierced the deep profound.</p>

<p>During the six months which we have just said had
elapsed since the domiciliation of Mlle. Marmont beneath
his roof, he had had many long and perfectly
frank conversations with her, upon the subject which
most deeply interested him. She had completely fathomed
his secret, and by degrees had learned to sympathize
with him, in his search into the hidden mysteries
of photographic science. She even became the frequent
companion of his chemical experiments, and
night after night attended him in his laboratory, when
the lazy world around them was buried in the profoundest
repose.</p>

<p>Still, there was one subject which, hitherto, he had
not broached, and that was the one in which she felt all
a woman's curiosity&mdash;<i>the offer to purchase an eye</i>. She
had long since ascertained the story of the one-eyed
pets in the parlor, and had not only ceased to wonder,
but was mentally conscious of having forgiven Pollexfen,
in her own enthusiasm for art.</p>

<p>Finally, a whole year elapsed since the death of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
father, and no extraordinary change took place in the
relations of the master and his pupil. True, each day
their intercourse became more unrestrained, and their
art-association more intimate. But this intimacy was
not the tie of personal friendship or individual esteem.
It began in the laboratory, and there it ended. Pollexfen
had no soul except for his art; no love outside of
his profession. Money he seemed to care for but little,
except as a means of supplying his acids, salts and
plates. He rigorously tested every metal, in its iodides
and bromides; industriously coated his plates with every
substance that could be albumenized, and plunged his
negatives into baths of every mineral that could be reduced
to the form of a vapor. His activity was prodigious;
his ingenuity exhaustless, his industry absolutely
boundless. He was as familiar with chemistry as he
was with the outlines of the geography of Scotland.
Every headland, spring and promontory of that science
he knew by heart. The most delicate experiments he
performed with ease, and the greatest rapidity. Nature
seemed to have endowed him with a native aptitude
for analysis. His love was as profound as it was
ready; in fact, if there was anything he detested more
than loud laughter, it was superficiality. He instinctively
pierced at once to the roots and sources of things;
and never rested, after seeing an effect, until he groped
his way back to the cause. "Never stand still," he
would often say to his pupil, "where the ground is
boggy. Reach the rock before you rest." This maxim
was the great index to his character; the key to all his
researches.</p>

<p>Time fled so rapidly and to Lucile so pleasantly, too,
that she had reached the very verge of her legal maturity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
before she once deigned to bestow a thought upon
what change, if any, her eighteenth birthday would
bring about. A few days preceding her accession to
majority, a large package of letters from France, <i>via</i>
New York, arrived, directed to M. Marmont himself,
and evidently written without a knowledge of his death.
The bundle came to my care, and I hastened at once to
deliver it, personally, to the blooming and really beautiful
Lucile. I had not seen her for many months, and
was surprised to find so great an improvement in her
health and appearance. Her manners were more
marked, her conversation more rapid and decided, and
the general contour of her form far more womanly. It
required only a moment's interview to convince me that
she possessed unquestioned talent of a high order, and
a spirit as imperious as a queen's. Those famous eyes
of hers, that had, nearly two years before, attracted in
such a remarkable manner the attention of Pollexfen,
had not failed in the least; on the contrary, time had
intensified their power, and given them a depth of
meaning and a dazzling brilliancy that rendered them
almost insufferably bright. It seemed to me that contact
with the magnetic gaze of the photographer had
lent them something of his own expression, and I confess
that when my eye met hers fully and steadily, mine
was always the first to droop.</p>

<p>Knowing that she was in full correspondence with
her lover, I asked after Courtland, and she finally told
me all she knew. He was still suffering from the
effect of the assassin's blow, and very recently had been
attacked by inflammatory rheumatism. His health
seemed permanently impaired, and Lucile wept bitterly
as she spoke of the poverty in which they were both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
plunged, and which prevented him from essaying the
only remedy that promised a radical cure.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed she, "were it only in our power to
visit <i>La belle France</i>, to bask in the sunshine of Dauphiny,
to sport amid the lakes of the Alps, to repose
beneath the elms of Chlons!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said I, "the very letters now unopened
in your hands may invite you back to the scenes of
your childhood."</p>

<p>"Alas! no," she rejoined, "I recognize the handwriting
of my widowed aunt, and I tremble to break
the seal."</p>

<p>Rising shortly afterwards, I bade her a sorrowful
farewell.</p>

<p>Lucile sought her private apartment before she ventured
to unseal the dispatches. Many of the letters
were old, and had been floating between New York and
Havre for more than a twelvemonth. One was of recent
date, and that was the first one perused by the
niece. Below is a free translation of its contents. It
bore date at "Bordeaux, July 12, 1853," and ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>E<span class="smsmcap">ver dear and beloved</span> B<span class="smsmcap">rother</span>:</p>

<p>Why have we never heard from you since the beginning of
1851? Alas! I fear some terrible misfortune has overtaken
you, and overwhelmed your whole family. Many times
have I written during that long period, and prayed, oh! so
promptly, that God would take you, and yours, in His holy
keeping. And then our dear Lucile! Ah! what a life must
be in store for her, in that wild and distant land! Beg of
her to return to France; and do not fail, also, to come
yourself. We have a new Emperor, as you must long since
have learned, in the person of Louis Bonaparte, nephew
of the great Napoleon. Your reactionist principles against
Cavaignac and his colleagues, can be of no disservice to you
at present. Napoleon is lenient. He has even recalled
Louis Blanc. Come, and apply for restitution of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
estates; come, and be a protector of my seven orphans,
now, alas! suffering even for the common necessaries of life.
Need a fond sister say more to her only living brother?</p>

<p class="center">Thine, as in childhood,</p>
<p class="sig">A<span class="smsmcap">nnette.</span></p>
</div>

<p>"Misfortunes pour like a pitiless winter storm upon
my devoted head," thought Lucile, as she replaced the
letter in its envelope. "Parents dead; aunt broken-hearted;
cousins starving, and I not able to afford
relief. I cannot even moisten their sorrows with a tear.
I would weep, but rebellion against fate rises in my
soul, and dries up the fountain of tears. Had Heaven
made me a man it would not have been thus. I have
something here," she exclaimed, rising from her seat
and placing her hand upon her forehead, "that tells
me I could do and dare, and endure."</p>

<p>Her further soliloquy was here interrupted by a distinct
rap at her door, and on pronouncing the word
"enter," Pollexfen, for the first time since she became
a member of his family, strode heavily into her chamber.
Lucile did not scream, or protest, or manifest
either surprise or displeasure at this unwonted and uninvited
visit. She politely pointed to a seat, and the
photographer, without apology or hesitation, seized the
chair, and moving it so closely to her own that they
came in contact, seated himself without uttering a syllable.
Then, drawing a document from his breast
pocket, which was folded formally, and sealed with two
seals, but subscribed only with one name, he proceeded
to read it from beginning to end, in a slow, distinct,
and unfaltering tone.</p>

<p>I have the document before me, as I write, and I
here insert a full and correct copy. It bore date just
one month subsequent to the time of the interview, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
was intended, doubtless, to afford his pupil full opportunity
for consultation before requesting her signature:</p>

</div>

<p>Having finished the perusal, the photographer looked
up, and the eyes of his pupil encountered his own.</p>

<p>And here terminates the third phase in the history of
John Pollexfen.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p class="secsc">PHASE THE FOURTH.</p>

<p>The confronting glance of the master and his pupil
was not one of those casual encounters of the eye
which lasts but for a second, and terminates in the
almost instantaneous withdrawal of the vanquished orb.
On the contrary, the scrutiny was long and painful.
Each seemed determined to conquer, and both knew
that flight was defeat, and quailing ruin. The photographer
felt a consciousness of superiority in himself,
in his cause and his intentions. These being pure and
commendable, he experienced no sentiment akin to the
weakness of guilt. The girl, on the other hand, struggled
with the emotions of terror, curiosity and defiance.
He thought, "Will she yield?" She, "Is this man in
earnest?" Neither seemed inclined to speak, yet both
grew impatient.</p>

<p>Nature finally vindicated her own law, that the most
powerful intellect must magnetize the weaker, and
Lucile, dropping her eye, said, with a sickened smile,
"Sir, are you jesting?"</p>

<p>"I am incapable of trickery," dryly responded
Pollexfen.</p>

<p>"But not of delusion?" suggested the girl.</p>

<p>"A fool may be deceived, a chemist never."</p>

<p>"And you would have the fiendish cruelty to tear out
one of my eyes before I am dead? Why, even the vulture
waits till his prey is carrion."</p>

<p>"I am not cruel," he responded; "I labor under no
delusion. I pursue no phantom. Where I now stand
experiment forced me. With the rigor of a mathematical
demonstration I have been driven to the proposition
set forth in this agreement. Nature cannot lie. The
earth revolves because it <i>must</i>. Causation controls the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
universe. Men speak of <i>accidents</i>, but a fortuitous circumstance
never happened since matter moved at the
fist of the Almighty. Is it chance that the prism decomposes
a ray of light? Is it chance, that by mixing
hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of two to one
in volume, water should be the result? How can
Nature err?"</p>

<p>"She cannot," Lucile responded, "but man may."</p>

<p>"That argues that I, too, am but human, and may fall
into the common category."</p>

<p>"Such was my thought."</p>

<p>"Then banish the idea forever. I deny not that I am
but mortal, but man was made in the image of God.
Truth is as clear to the perception of the creature, <i>when
seen at all</i>, as it is to that of the Creator. What is man
but a finite God? He moves about his little universe
its sole monarch, and with all the absoluteness of a deity,
controls its motions and settles its destiny. He may
not be able to number the sands on the seashore, but
he can count his flocks and herds. He may not create
a comet, or overturn a world, but he can construct the
springs of a watch, or the wheels of a mill, and they
obey him as submissively as globes revolve about their
centres, or galaxies tread in majesty the measureless
fields of space!</p>

<p>"For years," exclaimed he, rising to his feet, and
fixing his eagle glance upon his pupil, "for long and
weary years, I have studied the laws of light, color, and
motion. Why are my pictures sharper in outline, and
truer to nature, than those of rival artists around me?
Poor fools! whilst they slavishly copied what nobler
natures taught, I boldly trod in unfamiliar paths. I
invented, whilst they traveled on the beaten highway,
look at my lenses! They use glass&mdash;yes, common glass&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
a spectral power of 10, because they catch up
the childish notion of Dawson, and Harwick, that it is
impossible to prepare the most beautiful substance in
nature, next to the diamond&mdash;crystalized quartz&mdash;for the
purposes of art. Yet quartz has a power of refraction
equal to 74! Could John Pollexfen sleep quietly in his
bed whilst such an outrage was being perpetrated daily
against God and His universe? No! Lucile; never!
Yon snowy hills conceal in their bosoms treasures far
richer than the sheen of gold. With a single blast I
tore away a ton of crystal. How I cut and polished it
is my secret, not the world's. The result crowds my
gallery daily, whilst theirs are half deserted."</p>

<p>"And are you not satisfied with your success?" demanded
the girl, whose own eye began to dilate, and
gleam, as it caught the kindred spark of enthusiasm
from the flaming orbs of Pollexfen.</p>

<p>"Satisfied!" cried he; "satisfied! Not until my <i>camera</i>
flashes back the silver sheen of the planets, and the
golden twinkle of the stars. Not until earth and all her
daughters can behold themselves in yon mirror, clad in
their radiant robes. Not until each hue of the rainbow,
each tint of the flower, and the fitful glow of roseate
beauty, changeful as the tinge of summer sunsets, have
all been captured, copied, and embalmed forever by the
triumphs of the human mind! Least of all, could I be
satisfied now at the very advent of a nobler era in my
art."</p>

<p>"And do you really believe," inquired Lucile, "that
color can be photographed as faithfully as light and
shade?"</p>

<p>"Believe, girl? <i>I know it.</i> Does not your own
beautiful eye print upon its retina tints, dyes and hues
innumerable? And what is the eye but a lens? God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
was the first photographer. Give me but a living, sentient,
perfect human eye to dissect and analyze, and I
swear by the holy book of science that I will detect
the secret, though hidden deep down in the primal
particles of matter."</p>

<p>"And why a human eye? Why not an eagle's or a
lion's?"</p>

<p>"A question I once propounded to myself, and never
rested till it was solved," replied Pollexfen. "Go into
my parlor, and ask my pets if I have not been diligent,
faithful, and honest. I have tested every eye but the
human. From the dull shark's to the imperial condor's,
I have tried them all. Months elapsed ere I discovered
the error in my reasoning. Finally, a little
boy explained it all. 'Mother,' said a child, in my
hearing, 'when the pigeons mate, do they choose the
prettiest birds?' 'No,' said his mother. 'And why
not?' pursued the boy. Because, responded I, waking
as from a dream, <i>they have no perception of color!</i> The
animal world sports in light and shade; the human only
rejoices in the apprehension of color. Does the horse
admire the rainbow? or does the ox spare the buttercup
and the violet, because they are beautiful? The
secret lies in the human eye alone. An eye! an eye!
give me but one, Lucile!"</p>

<p>As the girl was about to answer, the photographer
again interposed, "Not now; I want no answer now; I
give you a month for reflection." And so saying, he
left the room as unceremoniously as he had entered.</p>

<p>The struggle in the mind of Lucile was sharp and
decisive. Dependent herself upon her daily labor, her
lover an invalid, and her nearest kindred starving, were
facts that spoke in deeper tones than the thunder to her
soul. Besides, was not one eye to be spared her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and was not a single eye quite as good as two? She
thought, too, how glorious it would be if Pollexfen
should not be mistaken, and she herself should conduce
so essentially to the noblest triumph of the photographic
art.</p>

<p>A shade, however, soon overspread her glowing face,
as the unbidden idea came forward: "And will my
lover still be faithful to a mutilated bride? Will not
my beauty be marred forever? But," thought she, "is
not this sacrifice for him? Oh, yes! we shall cling still
more closely in consequence of the very misfortune that
renders our union possible." One other doubt suggested
itself to her mind: "Is this contract legal? Can
it be enforced? If so," and here her compressed lips,
her dilated nostril, and her clenched hand betokened
her decision, "<i>if so, I yield!</i>"</p>

<p>Three weeks passed quickly away, and served but
to strengthen the determination of Lucile. At the expiration
of that period, and just one week before the
time fixed for the accomplishment of this cruel scheme,
I was interrupted, during the trial of a cause, by the
entry of my clerk, with a short note from Mademoiselle
Marmont, requesting my immediate presence at the
office. Apologizing to the judge, and to my associate
counsel, I hastily left the court-room.</p>

<p>On entering, I found Lucile completely veiled. Nor
was it possible, during our interview, to catch a single
glimpse of her features. She rose, and advancing toward
me, extended her hand; whilst pressing it I felt it
tremble.</p>

<p>"Read this document, Mr. Falconer, and advise me
as to its legality. I seek no counsel as to my duty. My
mind is unalterably fixed on that subject, and I beg of
you, as a favor, in advance, to spare yourself the trouble,
and me the pain, of reopening it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>If the speech, and the tone in which it was spoken,
surprised me, I need not state how overwhelming was
my astonishment at the contents of the document. I
was absolutely stunned. The paper fell from my hands
as though they were paralyzed. Seeing my embarrassment,
Lucile rose and paced the room in an excited
manner. Finally pausing, opposite my desk, she inquired,
"Do you require time to investigate the law?"</p>

<p>"Not an instant," said I, recovering my self-possession.
"This paper is not only illegal, but the execution
of it an offense. It provides for the perpetration
of the crime of <i>mayhem</i>, and it is my duty, as a good
citizen, to arrest the wretch who can contemplate so
heinous and inhuman an act, without delay. See! he
has even had the insolence to insert my own name as
paymaster for his villainy."</p>

<p>"I did not visit your office to hear my benefactor and
friend insulted," ejaculated the girl, in a bitter and defiant
tone. "I only came to get an opinion on a matter
of law."</p>

<p>"But this monster is insane, utterly crazy," retorted
I. "He ought, this moment, to be in a madhouse."</p>

<p>"Where they did put Tasso, and tried to put Galileo,"
she rejoined.</p>

<p>"In the name of the good God!" said I, solemnly,
"are you in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Were I not, I should not be here."</p>

<p>"Then our conversation must terminate just where it
began."</p>

<p>Lucile deliberately took her seat at my desk, and
seizing a pen hastily affixed her signature to the agreement,
and rising, left the office without uttering another
syllable.</p>

<p>"I have, at least, the paper," thought I, "and that I
intend to keep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>My plans were soon laid. I sat down and addressed
a most pressing letter to Mr. Courtland, informing him
fully of the plot of the lunatic, for so I then regarded
him, and urged him to hasten to San Francisco without
a moment's delay. Then, seizing my hat, I made a most
informal call on Dr. White, and consulted him as to
the best means of breaking through the conspiracy.
We agreed at once that, as Pollexfen had committed no
overt act in violation of law, he could not be legally
arrested, but that information must be lodged with the
chief of police, requesting him to detail a trustworthy
officer, whose duty it should be to obey us implicitly,
and be ready to act at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>All this was done, and the officer duly assigned for
duty. His name was Cloudsdale. We explained to him
fully the nature of the business intrusted to his keeping,
and took great pains to impress upon him the necessity
of vigilance and fidelity. He entered into the
scheme with alacrity, and was most profuse in his
promises.</p>

<p>Our settled plan was to meet at the outer door of the
photographer's gallery, at half-past ten o'clock <span class="allcaps">P. M.</span>, on
the 19th of November, 1853, and shortly afterwards to
make our way, by stratagem or force, into the presence
of Pollexfen, and arrest him on the spot. We hoped to
find such preparations on hand as would justify the
arrest, and secure his punishment. If not, Lucile was
to be removed, at all events, and conducted to a place
of safety. Such was the general outline. During the
week we had frequent conferences, and Cloudsdale
effected an entrance, on two occasions, upon some slight
pretext, into the room of the artist. But he could discover
nothing to arouse suspicion; so, at least, he informed
us. During the morning of the 19th, a warrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of arrest was duly issued, and lodged in the hands of
Cloudsdale for execution. He then bade us good morning,
and urged us to be promptly on the ground at half-past
ten. He told us that he had another arrest to make
on the Sacramento boat, when she arrived, but would
not be detained five minutes at the police office. This
was annoying, but we submitted with the best grace
possible.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, I got another glimpse at our
"trusty." The steamer left for Panama at one <span class="allcaps">P. M.</span>,
and I went on board to bid adieu to a friend who was a
passenger.</p>

<p>Cloudsdale was also there, and seemed anxious and
restive. He told me that he was on the lookout for a
highway robber, who had been tracked to the city, and
it might be possible that he was stowed away secretly
on the ship. Having business up town, I soon left, and
went away with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>As night approached I grew more and more nervous,
for the party most deeply interested in preventing this
crime had not made his appearance. Mr. Courtland
had not reached the city. Sickness or the miscarriage
of my letter, was doubtless the cause.</p>

<p>The Doctor and myself supped together, and then
proceeded to my chambers, where we armed ourselves
as heavily as though we were about to fight a battle.
We were both silent. The enormity of Pollexfen's contemplated
crime struck us dumb. The evening, however,
wore painfully away, and finally our watches pointed to
the time when we should take our position, as before
agreed upon.</p>

<p>We were the first on the ground. This we did not
specially notice then; but when five, then ten, and next,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
fifteen minutes elapsed, and the officer still neglected to
make his appearance, our uneasiness became extreme.
Twenty&mdash;<i>twenty-five</i> minutes passed; still Cloudsdale
was unaccountably detained. "Can he be already in
the rooms above?" we eagerly asked one another.
"Are we not betrayed?" exclaimed I, almost frantically.</p>

<p>"We have no time to spare in discussion," replied the
Doctor, and, advancing, we tried the door. It was
locked. We had brought a step-ladder, to enter by the
window, if necessary. Next, we endeavored to hoist
the window; it was nailed down securely. Leaping to
the ground we made an impetuous, united onset against
the door; but it resisted all our efforts to burst it in.
Acting now with all the promptitude demanded by the
occasion, we mounted the ladder, and by a simultaneous
movement broke the sash, and leaped into the room.
Groping our way hurriedly to the stairs, we had placed
our feet upon the first step, when our ears were saluted
with one long, loud, agonizing shriek. The next instant
we rushed into the apartment of Lucile, and beheld a
sight that seared our own eyeballs with horror, and
baffles any attempt at description.</p>

<p>Before our faces stood the ferocious demon, holding
in his arms the fainting girl, and hurriedly clipping,
with a pair of shears, the last muscles and integuments
which held the organ in its place.</p>

<p>"Hold! for God's sake, hold!" shouted Dr. White,
and instantly grappled with the giant. Alas! alas! it
was too late, forever! The work had been done; the
eye torn, bleeding, from its socket, and just as the Doctor
laid his arm upon Pollexfen, the ball fell, dripping
with gore, into his left hand.</p>

<p>This is the end of the fourth phase.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p class="secsc">PHASE THE FIFTH, AND LAST.</p>

<p>"Monster," cried I, "we arrest you for the crime of
mayhem."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, gentlemen," said the photographer, "you
will be kind enough to exhibit your warrant." As he
said this, he drew from his pocket with his right hand,
the writ of arrest which had been intrusted to Cloudsdale,
and deliberately lighting it in the candle, burned
it to ashes before we could arrest his movement. Lucile
had fallen upon a ready prepared bed, in a fit of pain,
and fainting. The Doctor took his place at her side, his
own eyes streaming with tears, and his very soul heaving
with agitation.</p>

<p>As for me, my heart was beating as audibly as a drum.
With one hand I grappled the collar of Pollexfen, and
with the other held a cocked pistol at his head.</p>

<p>He stood as motionless as a statue. Not a nerve
trembled nor a tone faltered, as he spoke these words:
"I am most happy to see you, gentlemen; especially
the Doctor, for he can relieve me of the duties of surgeon.
You, sir, can assist him as nurse." And shaking
off my hold as though it had been a child's, he sprang
into the laboratory adjoining, and locked the door as
quick as thought.</p>

<p>The insensibility of Lucile did not last long. Consciousness
returned gradually, and with it pain of the
most intense description. Still she maintained a rigidness
of feature, and an intrepidity of soul that excited
both sorrow and admiration. "Poor child! poor
child!" was all we could utter, and even that spoken
in whispers. Suddenly a noise in the laboratory attracted
attention. Rising I went close to the door.</p>

<p>"Two to one in measure; eight to one in weight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
water, only water," soliloquized the photographer. Then
silence, "Phosphorus; yellow in color; burns in oxygen."
Silence again.</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried I, "Doctor, he is analyzing her
eye! The fiend is actually performing his incantations!"</p>

<p>A moment elapsed. A sudden, sharp explosion; then
a fall, as if a chair had been upset, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Carbon in combustion! Carbon in combustion!"
in a wild, excited tone, broke from the lips of Pollexfen,
and the instant afterwards he stood at the bedside of his
pupil. "Lucile! Lucile! the secret is ours; ours only!"</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the girl lifted herself from
her pillow, whilst he proceeded: "Carbon in combustion;
I saw it ere the light died from the eyeball."</p>

<p>A smile lighted the pale face of the girl as she faintly
responded, "Regulus gave both eyes for his country;
I have given but one for my art."</p>

<p>Pressing both hands to my throbbing brow, I asked
myself, "Can this be real? Do I dream? If real, why
do I not assassinate the fiend? Doctor," said I, "we
must move Lucile. I will seek assistance."</p>

<p>"Not so," responded Pollexfen; the excitement of
motion might bring on erysipelas, or still worse, <i>tetanus</i>.</p>

<p>A motion from Lucile brought me to her bedside.
Taking from beneath her pillow a bank deposit-book,
and placing it in my hands, she requested me to hand
it to Courtland the moment of his arrival, which she
declared would be the 20th, and desire him to read the
billet attached to the banker's note of the deposit.
"Tell him," she whispered, "not to love me less in
my mutilation;" and again she relapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>The photographer now bent over the senseless form
of his victim, and muttering, "Yes, carbon in combustion,"
added, in a softened tone, "Poor girl!" As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
lifted his face, I detected a solitary tear course down
his impressive features. "The first I have shed," said
he, sternly, "since my daughter's death."</p>

<p>Saying nothing, I could only think&mdash;"And this wretch
once had a child!"</p>

<p>The long night through we stood around her bed.
With the dawn, Martha, the housekeeper, returned, and
we then learned, for the first time, with what consummate
skill Pollexfen had laid all his plans. For even
the housekeeper had been sent out of the way, and on
a fictitious pretense that she was needed at the bedside
of a friend, whose illness was feigned for the occasion.
Nor was the day over before we learned with certainty,
but no longer with surprise, that Cloudsdale was on his
way to Panama, with a bribe in his pocket.</p>

<p>As soon as it was safe to remove Lucile, she was borne
on a litter to the hospital of Dr. Peter Smith, where she
received every attention that her friends could bestow.</p>

<p>Knowing full well, from what Lucile had told me,
that Courtland would be down in the Sacramento boat,
I awaited his arrival with the greatest impatience. I
could only surmise what would be his course. But
judging from my own feelings, I could not doubt that
it would be both desperate and decisive.</p>

<p>Finally, the steamer rounded to, and the next moment
the pale, emaciated form of the youth sank, sobbing,
into my arms. Other tears mingled with his own.</p>

<p>The story was soon told. Eagerly, most eagerly,
Courtland read the little note accompanying the bankbook.
It was very simple, and ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>M<span class="smsmcap">y own life's</span> L<span class="smsmcap">ife:</span>&nbsp; Forgive the first, and only act, that
you will ever disapprove of in the conduct of your mutilated
but loving Lucile. Ah! can I still hope for your love, in
the future, as in the past? Give me but that assurance, and
death itself would be welcome.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="allcaps">L. M.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>We parted very late; he going to a hotel, I to the
bedside of the wounded girl. Our destinies would have
been reversed, but the surgeon's order was imperative,
that she should see no one whose presence might conduce
still further to bring on inflammation of the brain.</p>

<p>The next day, Courtland was confined to his bed until
late in the afternoon, when he dressed, and left the
hotel. I saw him no more until the subsequent day.
Why, it now becomes important to relate.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock in the evening of the 21st, the
day after his arrival, Courtland staggered into the gallery,
or rather the den of John Pollexfen. He had no
other arms than a short double-edged dagger, and this
he concealed in his sleeve.</p>

<p>They had met before; as he sometimes went there,
anterior to the death of M. Marmont, to obtain the
photographs upon which Lucile was experimenting, previous
to her engagement by the artist.</p>

<p>Pollexfen manifested no surprise at his visit; indeed,
his manner indicated that it had been anticipated.</p>

<p>"You have come into my house, young man," slowly
enunciated the photographer, "to take my life."</p>

<p>"I do not deny it," replied Courtland.</p>

<p>As he said this, he took a step forward. Pollexfen
threw open his vest, raised himself to his loftiest height,
and solemnly said: "Fire! or strike! as the case may
be; I shall offer no resistance. I only beg of you, as
a gentleman, to hear me through before you play the
part of assassin."</p>

<p>Their eyes met. The struck lamb gazing at the eagle!
Vengeance encountering Faith! The pause was but momentary.
"I will hear you," said Courtland, sinking
into a chair, already exhausted by his passion.</p>

<p>Pollexfen did not move. Confronting the lover, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
told his story truthfully to the end. He plead for his
life; for he felt the proud consciousness of having performed
an act of duty that bordered upon the heroic.</p>

<p>Still, there was no relenting in the eye of Courtland.
It had that expression in it that betokens blood. Csar
saw it as Brutus lifted his dagger. Henry of Navarre
recognized it as the blade of Ravillac sank into his
heart. Joaquin beheld it gleaming in the vengeful
orbs of Harry Love! Pollexfen, too, understood the
language that it spoke.</p>

<p>Dropping his hands, and taking one stride toward the
young man, he sorrowfully said: "I have but one word
more to utter. Your affianced bride has joyfully sacrificed
one of her lustrous eyes to science. In doing so,
she expressed but one regret, that you, whom she loved
better than vision, or even life, might, as the years roll
away, forget to love her in her mutilation as you did in
her beauty. Perfect yourself, she feared mating with
imperfection might possibly estrange your heart. Your
superiority in personal appearance might constantly
disturb the perfect equilibrium of love."</p>

<p>He ceased. The covert meaning was seized with
lightning rapidity by Courtland. Springing to his feet,
he exclaimed joyfully: "The sacrifice must be mutual.
God never created a soul that could outdo Charles
Courtland's in generosity."</p>

<p>Flinging his useless dagger upon the floor, he threw
himself into the already extended arms of the photographer,
and begged him "to be quick with the operation."
The artist required no second invitation, and
ere the last words died upon his lips, the sightless ball
of his left eye swung from its socket.</p>

<p>There was no cry of pain; no distortion of the young
man's features with agony; no moan, or sob, or sigh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
As he closed firmly his right eye, and compressed his
pallid lips, a joyous smile lit up his whole countenance
that told the spectator how superior even human love
is to the body's anguish; how willingly the severest
sacrifice falls at the beck of honor!</p>

<p>I shall attempt no description of the manner in which
I received the astounding news from the lips of the
imperturbable Pollexfen; nor prolong this narrative by
detailing the meeting of the lovers, their gradual recovery,
their marriage, and their departure for the vales
of Dauphiny. It is but just to add, however, that Pollexfen
added two thousand five hundred dollars to the
bank account of Mademoiselle Marmont, on the day of
her nuptials, as a bridal present, given, no doubt, partially
as a compensation to the heroic husband for his
voluntary mutilation.</p>

<p>Long months elapsed after the departure of Lucile
and her lover before the world heard anything more of
the photographer.</p>

<p>One day, however, in the early spring of the next
season, it was observed that Pollexfen had opened a new
and most magnificent gallery upon Montgomery Street,
and had painted prominently upon his sign, these words:</p>


<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap" style="font-size: 110%;">John Pollexfen, Photographer.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Discoverer of the Carbon Process,<br />
By which Colored Pictures are Painted by the Sun.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>The news of this invention spread, in a short time,
over the whole civilized world; and the Emperor Napoleon
the Third, with the liberality characteristic of great
princes, on hearing from the lips of Lucile a full account
of this wonderful discovery, revived, in favor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
John Pollexfen, the pension which had been bestowed
upon Nipce, and which had lapsed by his death, in
1839; and with a magnanimity that would have rendered
still more illustrious his celebrated uncle, revoked the
decree of forfeiture against the estates of M. Marmont,
and bestowed them, with a corresponding title of nobility,
upon Lucile and her issue.</p>

<p>This ends my story. I trust the patient reader will
excuse its length, for it was all necessary, in order to
explain how John Pollexfen made his fortune.</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>

<h3><i>THE AZTEC PRINCESS.</i></h3>

<p class="center">"Speaking marble."&mdash;B<span class="smsmcap">yron</span>.</p>


<p class="secsc">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="cap">In common with many of our countrymen, my attention
has been powerfully drawn to the subject of
American antiquities, ever since the publication of the
wonderful discoveries made by Stephens and Norman
Among the ruins of Uxmal and Palenque.</p>

<p>Yucatan and Chiapas have always spoken to my imagination
more forcibly than Egypt or Babylon; and in
my early dreams of ambition I aspired to emulate the
fame of Champollion <i>le Jeune</i>, and transmit my name
to posterity on the same page with that of the decipherer
of the hieroglyphics on the pyramids of
Ghizeh.</p>

<p>The fame of warriors and statesmen is transient and
mean, when compared to that of those literary colossii
whose herculean labors have turned back upon itself the
tide of oblivion, snatched the scythe from the hands of
Death, and, reversing the duties of the fabled Charon,
are now busily engaged in ferrying back again across
the Styx the shades of the illustrious dead, and landing
them securely upon the shores of true immortality, the
ever-living Present! Even the laurels of the poet and
orator, the historian and philosopher, wither, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pale their ineffectual fires"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>in the presence of that superiority&mdash;truly godlike in its
attributes&mdash;which, with one wave of its matchless wand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
conjures up whole realms, reconstructs majestic empires,
peoples desolate wastes&mdash;voiceless but yesterday,
save with the shrill cry of the bittern&mdash;and, contemplating
the midnight darkness shrouding Thebes and
Nineveh, cries aloud, "Let there be light!" and suddenly
Thotmes starts from his tomb, the dumb pyramids
become vocal, Nimroud wakes from his sleep of four
thousand years, and, springing upon his battle-horse,
once more leads forth his armies to conquest and glory.
The unfamiliar air learns to repeat accents, forgotten
ere the foundations of Troy were laid, and resounds
once more with the echoes of a tongue in which old
Menes wooed his bride, long before Noah was commanded
to build the Ark, or the first rainbow smiled
upon the cloud.</p>

<p>All honor, then, to the shades of Young and Champollion,
Lepsius and De Lacy, Figeac and Layard. Alexander
and Napoleon conquered kingdoms, but they were
ruled by the living. On the contrary, the heroes I have
mentioned vanquished mighty realms, governed alone
by the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Monarch of the Scythe and Glass,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that unsubstantial king, who erects his thrones on
broken columns and fallen domes, waves his sceptre
over dispeopled wastes, and builds his capitals amid
the rocks of Petra and the catacombs of Egypt.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Such being the object of my ambition, it will not
appear surprising that I embraced every opportunity to
enlarge my knowledge of my favorite subject&mdash;American
Antiquities&mdash;and eagerly perused every new volume
purporting to throw any light upon it. I was perfectly
familiar with the works of Lord Kingsborough
and Dr. Robertson before I was fifteen years of age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and had studied the explorations of Bernal Diaz, Waldeck,
and Dupaix, before I was twenty. My delight,
therefore, was boundless when a copy of Stephens's
travels in Yucatan and Chiapas fell into my hands, and
I devoured his subsequent publications on the same
subject with all the avidity of an enthusiast. Nor did
my labors stop here. Very early I saw the importance
of an acquaintance with aboriginal tongues, and immediately
set about mastering the researches of Humboldt
and Schoolcraft. This was easily done; for I discovered,
much to my chagrin and disappointment, that but
little is known of the languages of the Indian tribes,
and that little is soon acquired. Dissatisfied with such
information as could be gleaned from books only, I applied
for and obtained an agency for dispensing Indian
rations among the Cherokees and Ouchitaws, and set
out for Fort Towson in the spring of 1848.</p>

<p>Soon after my arrival I left the fort, and took up my
residence at the wigwam of Sac-a-ra-sa, one of the principal
chiefs of the Cherokees. My intention to make
myself familiar with the Indian tongues was noised
abroad, and every facility was afforded me by my hospitable
friends. I took long voyages into the interior of
the continent, encountered delegations from most of the
western tribes, and familiarized myself with almost every
dialect spoken by the Indians dwelling west of the Rocky
Mountains. I devoted four years to this labor, and at
the end of that period, with my mind enriched by a
species of knowledge unattainable by a mere acquaintance
with books, I determined to visit Central America
in person, and inspect the monuments of Uxmal and
Palenque with my own eyes.</p>

<p>Full of this intention, I took passage on the steamship
"Prometheus," in December, 1852, bound from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
New York to Greytown, situated in the State of Nicaragua;
a point from which I could easily reach Chiapas
or Yucatan.</p>

<p>And at this point of my narrative, it becomes necessary
to digress for a moment, and relate an incident
which occurred on the voyage, and which, in its consequences,
changed my whole mode of investigation, and
introduced a new element of knowledge to my attention.</p>

<p>It so happened that Judge E&mdash;&mdash;, formerly on the
Bench of the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
was a fellow-passenger. He had been employed by the
Nicaragua Transit Company to visit Leon, the capital
of Nicaragua, and perfect some treaty stipulations with
regard to the project of an interoceanic canal. Fellow-passengers,
we of course became acquainted almost
immediately, and at an early day I made respectful
inquiries concerning that science to which he had of
late years consecrated his life&mdash;I mean the "Theory of
Spiritual Communion between the Two Worlds of Matter
and Spirit." The judge was as communicative as I
could desire, and with the aid of two large manuscript
volumes (which were subsequently given to the public),
he introduced me at once into the profoundest arcana
of the science. I read his books through with the deepest
interest, and though not by any means convinced,
I was startled and bewildered. The most powerful
instincts of my nature were aroused, and I frankly
acknowledged to my instructor, that an irresistible curiosity
had seized me to witness some of those strange
phenomena with which his volumes superabounded.
Finally, I extorted a promise from him, that on our
arrival at Greytown, if a favorable opportunity presented,
he would endeavor to form the mystical circle,
and afford me the privilege I so much coveted&mdash;<i>to see
for myself</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> The anticipated experiments formed the
staple of our conversation for the six weary days and
nights that our trip occupied. Finally, on the morning
of the seventh day, the low and wooded coast of Nicaragua
gently rose in the western horizon, and before
twelve o'clock we were safely riding at anchor within
the mouth of the San Juan River. But here a new vexation
was in store for us. The river boats commenced
firing up, and before dark we were transferred from our
ocean steamer to the lighter crafts, and were soon afterwards
leisurely puffing our way up the river.</p>

<p>The next day we arrived at the upper rapids, where
the little village of Castillo is situated, and where we
had the pleasure of being detained five or six days,
awaiting the arrival of the California passengers. This
delay was exactly what I most desired, as it presented
the opportunity long waited for with the utmost impatience.
But the weather soon became most unfavorable,
and the rain commenced falling in torrents. The Judge
declared that it was useless to attempt anything so long
as it continued to rain. But on the third evening he
consented to make the experiment, provided the materials
of a circle could be found. We were not long
in suspense, for two young ladies from Indiana, a young
doctor from the old North State (now a practicing
physician in Stockton, California), and several others,
whose names I have long since forgotten, volunteered
to take part in the mysterious proceedings.</p>

<p>But the next difficulty was to find a place to meet in.
The doctor and I started off on a tour through the village
to prepare a suitable spot. The rain was still
falling, and the night as dark as Erebus. Hoisting our
umbrellas, we defied night and storm. Finally, we succeeded
in hiring a room in the second story of a building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
in process of erection, procured one or two lanterns,
and illuminated it to the best of our ability. Soon
afterwards we congregated there, but as the doors and
windows were not put in, and there were no chairs or
tables, we were once more on the point of giving up in
despair. Luckily there were fifteen or twenty baskets
of claret wine unopened in the room, and these we
arranged for seats, substituting an unhinged door, balanced
on a pile of boxes, for the leaf of a table. Our
rude contrivance worked admirably, and before an hour
had rolled by we had received a mass of communications
from all kinds of people in the spirit world, and
fully satisfied ourselves that the Judge was either a
wizard or what he professed to be&mdash;a <i>medium</i> of communication
with departed spirits.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to detail all the messages we received;
one only do I deem it important to notice. A
spirit, purporting to be that of Horatio Nelson, rapped
out his name, and stated that he had led the assault on
the Spaniards in the attack of the old Fort of Castillo
frowning above us, and there first distinguished himself
in life. He declared that these mouldering ruins were
one of his favorite haunts, and that he prided himself
more on the assault and capture of <i>Castillo Viejo</i> than
on the victory of the Nile or triumph of Trafalgar.</p>

<p>The circle soon afterwards dispersed, and most of
those who had participated in it were, in a few minutes,
slumbering in their cots. As for myself, I was astounded
with all that I had witnessed, but at the same
time delighted beyond measure at the new field opening
before me. I tossed from side to side, unable to
close my eyes or to calm down the excitement, until,
finding that sleep was impossible, I hastily rose, threw
on my coat, and went to the door, which was slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
ajar. On looking out, I observed a person passing
toward the foot of the hill upon which stood the Fort
of Castillo Viejo. The shower had passed off, and the
full moon was riding majestically in mid heavens. I
thought I recognized the figure, and I ventured to accost
him. It was the Judge. He also had been unable
to sleep, and declared that a sudden impulse drove him
forth into the open air.</p>

<p>Gradually he had approached the foot of the hill,
which shot up, like a sugar-loaf, two or three hundred
feet above the level of the stream, and had just made
up his mind to ascend it when I spoke to him. I
readily consented to accompany him, and we immediately
commenced climbing upwards.</p>

<p>The ascent was toilsome, as well as dangerous, and
more than once we were on the point of descending
without reaching the summit. Still, however, we
clambered on, and at half-past one o'clock <span class="allcaps">A. M.</span>, we
succeeded in our effort, and stood upon the old stone
rampart that had for more than half a century been
slowly yielding to the remorseless tooth of Time.
Abandoned for many years, the ruins presented the
very picture of desolation. Rank vines clung upon
every stone, and half filled up with their green tendrils
the yawning crevices everywhere gaping at us, and
whispering of the flight of years.</p>

<p>We sat down on a broken fragment that once served
as the floor of a port-hole, and many minutes elapsed
before either of us spoke a word. We were busy with
the past. Our thoughts recalled the terrible scenes
which this same old fort witnessed on that glorious day
when the youthful Nelson planted with his own hand
the flag of St. George upon the very ramparts where we
were sitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>How long we had been musing I know not; but suddenly
we heard a low, long-drawn sigh at our very ears.
Each sprang to his feet, looked wildly around, but
seeing nothing, gazed at the other in blank astonishment.
We resumed our seats, but had hardly done so,
when a deep and most anguishing groan was heard,
that pierced our very hearts. This time we retained
our position. I had unclosed my lips, preparatory to
speaking to my companion, when I felt myself distinctly
touched upon the shoulder. My voice died
away inarticulately, and I shuddered with ill-concealed
terror. But my companion was perfectly calm, and
moved not a nerve or a muscle. Able at length to speak,
I said, "Judge, let us leave this haunted sepulchre."</p>

<p>"Not for the world," he coolly replied. "You have
been anxious for spiritual phenomena; now you can witness
them unobserved and without interruption."</p>

<p>As he said this, my right arm was seized with great
force, and I was compelled to resign myself to the control
of the presence that possessed me. My right hand
was then placed on the Judge's left breast, and his left
hand laid gently on my right shoulder. At the same
time he took a pencil and paper from his pocket, and
wrote very rapidly the following communication, addressed
to me:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Grave hath its secrets, but the Past has none.
Time may crumble pyramids in the dust, but the genius of
man can despoil him of his booty, and rescue the story of
buried empires from oblivion. Even now the tombs of
Egypt are unrolling their recorded epitaphs. Even now
the sculptured mounds of Nineveh are surrendering the
history of Nebuchadnezzar's line. Before another generation
shall pass away, the columns of Palenque shall find a
tongue, and the <i>bas-reliefs</i> of Uxmal wake the dead from
their sleep of two thousand years. Young man! open your
eyes; we shall meet again amid the ruins of the <i>Casa
Grande!</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>At this moment the Judges hand fell palsied at his
side, and the paper was thrust violently into my left
hand. I held it up so as to permit the rays of the
moon to fall full upon it, and read it carefully from
beginning to end. But no sooner had I finished reading
it than a shock something like electricity struck us
simultaneously, and seemed to rock the old fort to its
very foundation. Everything near us was apparently
affected by it, and several large bowlders started from
their ticklish beds and rolled away down the mountain.
Our surprise at this was hardly over, ere one still greater
took possession of us. On raising our eyes to the moss-grown
parapet, we beheld a figure sitting upon it that
bore a very striking resemblance to the pictures in the
Spanish Museum at Madrid of the early Aztec princes.
It was a female, and she bore upon her head a most
gorgeous headdress of feathers, called a <i>Panache</i>. Her
face was calm, clear, and exceedingly beautiful. The
nose was prominent&mdash;more so than the Mexican or Tezcucan&mdash;and
the complexion much lighter. Indeed, by
the gleam of the moonlight, it appeared as white as that
of a Caucasian princess, and were an expression full of
benignity and love.</p>

<p>Our eyes were riveted upon this beautiful apparition,
and our lips silent. She seemed desirous of speaking,
and once or twice I beheld her lips faintly moving.
Finally, raising her white, uncovered arm, she pointed
to the north, and softly murmured, "<i>Palenque!</i>"</p>

<p>Before we could resolve in our minds what to say in
reply, the fairy princess folded her arms across her
breast, and disappeared as suddenly and mysteriously
as she had been evoked from night. We spoke not a
word to each other, but gazed long and thoughtfully at
the spot where the bright vision had gladdened and bewildered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
our sight. By a common impulse, we turned
to leave, and descended the mountain in silence as deep
as that which brooded over chaos ere God spoke creation
into being. We soon reached the foot of the hill,
and parted, with no word upon our lips, though with the
wealth of untold worlds gathered up in our hearts.</p>

<p>Never, since that bright and glorious tropical night,
have I mentioned the mysterious scene we witnessed on
the ramparts of Fort Castillo; and I have every reason to
believe that my companion has been as discreet.</p>

<p>This, perhaps, will be the only record that shall transmit
it to the future; but well I know that its fame will
render me immortal.</p>

<p>Through me and me alone, the sculptured marbles of
Central America have found a tongue. By my efforts,
Palenque speaks of her buried glories, and Uxmal
wakes from oblivion's repose. Even the old pyramid
of Cholula yields up its bloody secrets, and <i>Casa Grande</i>
reveals the dread history of its royalties.</p>

<p>The means by which a key to the monumental hieroglyphics
of Central America was furnished me, as well
as a full account of the discoveries made at Palenque,
will be narrated in the subsequent chapters of this
history.</p>

<p class="secsc">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Amid all the wreck of empires, nothing ever spoke so forcibly the
world's mutations, as this immense forest, shrouding what was once a
great city."&mdash;S<span class="smsmcap">tephens.</span></p>

<p>At daylight on the next morning after the singular
adventure recorded in the preceding chapter, the California
passengers bound eastward arrived, and those of
us bound to the westward were transshipped to the same
steamer which they had just abandoned. In less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
an hour we were all aboard, and the little river-craft was
busily puffing her way toward the fairy shores of Lake
Nicaragua.</p>

<p>For me, however, the evergreen scenery of the tropics
possessed no charms, and its balmy air no enchantments.
Sometimes, as the steamer approached the ivy-clad
banks, laden as they were with flowers of every
hue, and alive with ten thousand songsters of the richest
and most variegated plumage, my attention would be
momentarily aroused, and I enjoyed the sweet fragrance
of the flowers, and the gay singing of the birds. But
my memory was busy with the past, and my imagination
with the future. With the Judge, even, I could
not converse for any length of time, without falling into
a reverie by no means flattering to his powers of conversation.
About noon, however, I was fully aroused
to the beauty and sublimity of the surrounding scenery.
We had just passed Fort San Carlos, at the junction of
the San Juan River with the lake, and before us was
spread out like an ocean that magnificent sheet of water.
It was dotted all over with green islands, and reminded
me of the picture drawn by Addison of the Vision of
Mirza.</p>

<p>Here, said I to myself, is the home of the blest.
These emerald islets, fed by vernal skies, never grow
sere and yellow in the autumn; never bleak and desolate
in the winter. Perpetual summer smiles above
them, and wavelets dimpled by gentle breezes forever
lave their shores. Rude storms never howl across these
sleeping billows, and the azure heavens whisper eternal
peace to the lacerated heart.</p>

<p>Hardly had these words escaped my lips, when a loud
report, like a whole park of artillery, suddenly shook
the air. It seemed to proceed from the westward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
on turning our eyes in that direction, we beheld the
true cause of the phenomenon. Ometepe was in active
eruption. It had given no admonitory notice of the
storm which had been gathering in its bosom, but like
the wrath of those dangerous men we sometimes encounter
in life, it had hidden its vengeance beneath
flowery smiles, and covered over its terrors with deceitful
calm.</p>

<p>In a moment the whole face of nature was changed.
The skies became dark and lurid, the atmosphere heavy
and sultry, and the joyous waters across which we had
been careering only a moment before with animation
and laughter, rose in tumultuous swells, like the cross-seas
in the Mexican Gulf after a tornado. Terror seized
all on board the steamer, and the passengers were clamorous
to return to Fort San Carlos. But the captain
was inexorable, and seizing the wheel himself, he defied
the war of the elements, and steered the vessel on her
ordinary course. This lay directly to the south of
Ometepe, and within a quarter of a mile of the foot of
the volcano.</p>

<p>As we approached the region of the eruption, the
waters of the lake became more and more troubled, and
the air still more difficult to respire. Pumice-stone,
seemingly as light as cork, covered the surface of the
lake, and soon a terrific shower of hot ashes darkened
the very sun. Our danger at this moment was imminent
in the extreme, for, laying aside all consideration
of peril from the volcano itself, it was with great difficulty
that the ashes could be swept from the deck fast
enough to prevent the woodwork from ignition. But
our chief danger was still in store for us; for just as we
had arrived directly under the impending summit, as it
were, a fearful explosion took place, and threatened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
ingulf us all in ruin. The crater of the volcano, which
previously had only belched forth ashes and lava, now
sent up high into the heavens a sheet of lurid fire. It
did not resemble gases in combustion, which we denominate
flame, flickering for a moment in transitory splendor,
and then dying out forever. On the contrary, it
looked more like <i>frozen fire</i> if the expression may be
allowed. It presented an appearance of solidity that
seemed to defy abrasion or demolition, and rose into the
blue sky like a marble column of lightning. It was far
brighter than ordinary flame, and cast a gloomy and
peculiar shadow upon the deck of the steamer. At the
same instant the earth itself shook like a summer reed
when swept by a storm, and the water struck the sides
of the vessel like some rocky substance. Every atom
of timber in her trembled and quivered for a moment,
then grew into senseless wood once more. At this
instant, the terrific cry of "Fire!" burst from a hundred
tongues, and I had but to cast my eyes toward the
stern of the ship to realize the new peril at hand. The
attention of the passengers was now equally divided
between the burning ship and the belching volcano.
The alternative of a death by flame, or by burial in the
lake was presented to each of us.</p>

<p>In a few moments more the captain, crew, and
passengers, including seventeen ladies, were engaged
hand to hand with the enemy nearest to us. Buckets,
pumps, and even hats, were used to draw up water
from the lake and pass to those hardy spirits that
dared to press closest to the flames. But I perceived
at once that all would prove unavailing. The fire
gained upon the combatants every moment, and a general
retreat took place toward the stem of the steamer.
Fully satisfied what would be the fate of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
remained upon the ship, I commenced preparing to
throw myself into the water, and for that purpose was
about tearing one of the cabin doors from its hinges,
when the Judge came up, and accosted me.</p>

<p>He was perfectly calm; nor could I, after the closest
scrutiny of his features, detect either excitement, impatience,
or alarm. In astonishment I exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Sir, death is at the doors! Prepare to escape from
the burning ship."</p>

<p>"There is no danger," he replied calmly; "and even
if there were, what is this thing that we call <i>death</i>, that
we should fear it? Compose yourself, young man;
there is as yet no danger. I have been forewarned of
this scene, and not a soul of us shall perish."</p>

<p>Regarding him as a madman, I tore the door from its
hinges with the strength of despair, and rushing to the
side of the ship, was in the very act of plunging overboard,
when a united shriek of all the passengers rose
upon my ear, and I paused involuntarily to ascertain
the new cause of alarm. Scarcely did I have time to
cast one look at the mountain, ere I discovered that the
flames had all been extinguished at its crater, and that
the air was darkened by a mass of vapor, rendering the
sunlight a mockery and a shadow. But this eclipse
was our redemption. The next moment a sheet of cool
water fell upon the ship, and in such incredible masses,
that many articles were washed overboard, and the
door I held closely in my hands was borne away by the
flood. The fire was completely extinguished, and, ere
we knew it, the danger over.</p>

<p>Greatly puzzled how to account for the strange turn
in our affairs, I was ready at the moment to attribute it
to Judge E&mdash;&mdash;, and I had almost settled the question
that he was a necromancer, when he approached me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and putting an open volume in my hand, which I ascertained
was a "History of the Republic of Guatemala,"
I read the following incident:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nor is it true that volcanoes discharge only fire and
molten lava from their craters. On the contrary, they frequently
shower down water in almost incredible quantities,
and cause oftentimes as much mischief by floods as they do
by flames. An instance of this kind occurred in the year
1542, which completely demolished one half the buildings
in the city of Guatemala. It was chiefly owing to this
cause that the site of the city was changed; the ancient site
being abandoned, and the present locality selected for the
capital.<a name="FNanchor_A-109_1" id="FNanchor_A-109_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A-109_1" class="fnanchor">[A-109]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p>Six months after the events recorded above, I dismounted
from my mule near the old <i>cabilda</i> in the
modern village of Palenque. During that interval I
had met with the usual fortune of those who travel
alone in the interior of the Spanish-American States.
The war of castes was at its height, and the cry of <i>Carrera</i>
and <i>Morazan</i> greeted the ear of the stranger at
almost every turn of the road. Morazan represented
the aristocratic idea, still prevalent amongst the better
classes in Central America; whilst Carrera, on the other
hand, professed the wildest liberty and the extremest
democracy. The first carried in his train the wealth,
official power, and refinement of the country; the latter
drew after him that huge old giant, <i>Plebs.</i>, who in days
gone by has pulled down so many thrones, built the
groundwork of so many republics, and then, by fire and
sword and barbarian ignorance, laid their trophies in the
dust. My sense and sympathy took different directions.
Reason led me to the side of Morazan; but early prejudices
carried me over to Carrera. Very soon, however,
I was taught the lesson, that power in the hands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
rabble is the greatest curse with which a country can
be afflicted, and that a <i>paper constitution</i> never yet made
men free. I found out, too, that the entire population
was a rabble and that it made but little difference
which hero was in the ascendant. The plunder of the
laboring-classes was equally the object of both, and
anarchy the fate of the country, no matter who held the
reins. Civil wars have corrupted the whole population.
The men are all <i>bravos</i>, and the women coquettes. The
fireside virtues are unknown. It will be generations
before those pseudo-republicans will learn that there can
be no true patriotism where there is no country; there
can be no country where there are no homes; there can
be no home where woman rules not from the throne of
Virtue with the sceptre of Love!</p>

<p>I had been robbed eighteen times in six months; taken
prisoner four times by each party; sent in chains to the
city of Guatemala, twice by Carrera, and once by Morazan
as a spy; and condemned to be shot as a traitor by
both chieftains. In each instance I owed my liberation
to the American Consul-General, who, having heard the
object with which I visited the country, determined that
it should not be thwarted by these intestine broils.</p>

<p>Finally, as announced above, I reached the present
termination of my journey, and immediately commenced
preparations to explore the famous ruins in the neighborhood.
The first want of a traveler, no matter
whither he roams, is a guide; and I immediately called
at the redstone residence of the Alcalde, and mentioned
to him my name, the purport of my visit to Central
America, and the object of my present call upon him.
Eying me closely from head to foot, he asked me if I
had any money ("Tiene V. dinero?")</p>

<p>"Si, senor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>"Cuanto?"</p>

<p>"Poco mas de quinientos pesos."</p>

<p>"Bien; sientase."</p>

<p>So I took a seat upon a shuck-bottom stool, and
awaited the next move of the high dignitary. Without
responding directly to my application for a guide, he
suddenly turned the conversation, and demanded if I
was acquainted with Senor Catherwood or <i>el gobernador</i>.
(I afterwards learned that Mr. Stephens was
always called Governor by the native population in the
vicinity of Palenque.) I responded in the negative.
He then informed me that these gentlemen had sent
him a copy of their work on Chiapas, and at the same
time a large volume, that had been recently translated
into Spanish by a member of the Spanish Academy,
named Don Donoso Cortes, which he placed in my
hands.</p>

<p>My astonishment can be better imagined than described,
when, on turning to the title-page, I ascertained
that the book was called "<i>Nature's Divine Revelations</i>.
By <span class="smcap">A. J. Davis</span>. <i>Traducido, etc.</i>"</p>

<p>Observing my surprise, the Alcalde demanded if I
knew the author.</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," said I; "he is my&mdash;&mdash;" But I
must not anticipate.</p>

<p>After assuring me that he regarded the work as the
greatest book in the world, next to the Bible and Don
Quixote, and that he fully believed every line in it,
<i>including the preface</i>, he abruptly left the room, and
went into the court-yard behind the house.</p>

<p>I had scarcely time to take a survey of the ill-furnished
apartment, when he returned, leading in by a rope,
made of horsehair, called a "larriete," a youth whose
arms were pinioned behind him, and whose features
wore the most remarkable expression I ever beheld.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>Amazed, I demanded who this young man was, and
why he had been introduced to my notice. He replied,
without noticing in the slightest degree my surprise,
that <i>Pio</i>&mdash;for that was his name&mdash;was the best guide to
the ruins that the village afforded; that he was taken
prisoner a few months before from a marauding party
of <i>Caribs</i> (here the young man gave a low, peculiar
whistle and a negative shake of the head), and that if
his escape could be prevented by me, he would be found
to be invaluable.</p>

<p>I then asked Pio if he understood the Spanish language,
but he evinced no comprehension of what I said.
The Alcalde remarked that the <i>mozo</i> was very cunning,
and understood a great deal more than he pretended;
that he was by law his (the Alcalde's) slave, being a
Carib by birth, and uninstructed totally in religious exercises;
in fact, that he was a neophyte, and had been
placed in his hands by the Padre to teach the rudiments
of Christianity.</p>

<p>I next demanded of Pio if he was willing to conduct
me to the ruins. A gleam of joy at once illuminated
his features, and, throwing himself at my feet, he gazed
upward into my face with all the simplicity of a child.</p>

<p>But I did not fail to notice the peculiar posture he
assumed whilst sitting. It was not that of the American
Indian, who carelessly lolls upon the ground, nor that
of the Hottentot, who sits flatly, with his knees upraised.
On the contrary, the attitude was precisely the same as
that sculptured on the <i>basso-rilievos</i> at Uxmal, Palenque,
and throughout the region of Central American ruins.
I had first observed it in the Aztec children exhibited a
few years ago throughout the United States. The
weight of the body seemed to be thrown on the inside
of the thighs, and the feet turned outward, but drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
up closely to the body. No sooner did I notice this
circumstance than I requested Pio to rise, which he
did. Then, pretending suddenly to change my mind, I
requested him to be seated again. This I did to ascertain
if the first attitude was accidental. But on resuming
his seat, he settled down with great ease and celerity
into the self-same position, and I felt assured that I was
not mistaken. It would have required the united certificates
of all the population in the village, after that,
to convince me that Pio was a Carib. But aside from
this circumstance, which might by possibility have been
accidental, neither the color, expression, nor structure
of his face indicated Caribbean descent. On the contrary,
the head was smaller, the hair finer, the complexion
several shades lighter, and the facial angle
totally different. There was a much closer resemblance
to Jew than to Gentile; indeed, the peculiar curve of the
nose, and the Syrian leer of the eye, disclosed an Israelitish
ancestry rather than an American.</p>

<p>Having settled these points in my own mind very
rapidly, the Alcalde and I next chaffered a few moments
over the price to be paid for Pio's services. This was
soon satisfactorily arranged, and the boy was delivered
into my charge. But before doing so formally, the
Alcalde declared that I must never release him whilst in
the woods or amongst the ruins, or else he would escape,
and fly back to his barbarian friends, and the Holy
Apostolic Church would lose a convert. He also added,
by way of epilogue, that if I permitted him to get
away, his price was <i>cien pesos</i> (one hundred dollars).</p>

<p>The next two hours were devoted to preparations for
a life in the forest. I obtained the services of two
additional persons; one to cook and the other to assist
in clearing away rubbish and stones from the ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>Mounting my mule, already heavily laden with provisions,
mosquito bars, bedding, cooking utensils, etc.,
we turned our faces toward the southeast, and left the
modern village of Palenque. For the first mile I obeyed
strictly the injunctions of the Alcalde, and held Pio
tightly by the rope. But shortly afterwards we crossed
a rapid stream, and on mounting the opposite bank, we
entered a dense forest. The trees were of a gigantic
size, very lofty, and covered from trunk to top with
parasites of every conceivable kind. The undergrowth
was luxuriant, and in a few moments we found ourselves
buried in a tomb of tropical vegetation. The light of
the sun never penetrates those realms of perpetual
shadow, and the atmosphere seems to take a shade from
the pervading gloom. Occasionally a bright-plumed
songster would start up and dart through the inaccessible
foliage, but more frequently we disturbed snakes
and lizards in our journey.</p>

<p>After traversing several hundred yards of this primeval
forest I called a halt, and drew Pio close up to the
side of my mule. Then, taking him by the shoulder,
I wheeled him round quickly, and drawing a large
knife which I had purchased to cut away the thick foliage
in my exploration, I deliberately severed the cords
from his hands, and set him free. Instead of bounding
off like a startled deer, as my attendants expected to see
him do, he seized my hand, pressed it respectfully between
his own, raised the back of it to his forehead,
and then imprinted a kiss betwixt the thumb and forefinger.
Immediately afterward, he began to whistle in
a sweet low tone, and taking the lead of the party, conducted
us rapidly into the heart of the forest.</p>

<p>We had proceeded about seven or eight miles, crossing
two or three small rivers in our way, when the guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
suddenly throw up his hands, and pointing to a huge
pile of rubbish and ruins in the distance, exclaimed
"<i>El Palacio!</i>"</p>

<p>This was the first indication he had as yet given of his
ability to speak or to understand the Spanish, or, indeed,
any tongue, and I was congratulating myself upon the
discovery, when he subsided into a painful silence, interrupted
only by an occasional whistle, nor would he
make any intelligible reply to the simplest question.</p>

<p>We pushed on rapidly, and in a few moments more I
stood upon the summit of the pyramidal structure, upon
which, as a base, the ruins known as <i>El Palacio</i> are
situated.</p>

<p>These ruins have been so frequently described, that I
deem it unnecessary to enter into any detailed account
of them; especially as by doing so but little progress
would be made with the more important portions of this
narrative. If, therefore, the reader be curious to get a
more particular insight into the form, size, and appearance
of these curious remains, let him consult the
splendidly illuminated pages of Del Rio, Waldeck, and
Dupaix. Nor should Stephens and Catherwood be
neglected; for though their explorations are less scientific
and thorough than either of the others, yet being
more modern, they will prove not less interesting.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Several months had now elapsed since I swung my
hammock in one of the corridors of the old palace.
The rainy season had vanished, and the hot weather
once more set in for the summer. Still I worked on. I
took accurate and correct drawings of every engraved
entablature I could discover. With the assistance of my
taciturn guide, nothing seemed to escape me. Certain
am I that I was enabled to copy <i>basso-rilievos</i> never seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
by any of the great travelers whose works I had read;
for Pio seemed to know by intuition exactly where they
were to be found. My collection was far more complete
than Mr. Catherwood's, and more faithful to the
original than Lord Kingsborough's. Pio leaned over
my shoulder whilst I was engaged in drawing, and if I
committed the slightest error his quick glance detected
it at once, and a short, rough whistle recalled my pencil
back to its duty.</p>

<p>Finally, I completed the last drawing I intended to
make, and commenced preparations to leave my quarters,
and select others affording greater facilities for
the study of the various problems connected with these
mysterious hieroglyphics. I felt fully sensible of the
immense toil before me, but having determined long
since to devote my whole life to the task of interpreting
these silent historians of buried realms, hope gave me
strength to venture upon the work, and the first step
toward it had just been successfully accomplished.</p>

<p>But what were paintings, and drawings, and sketches,
without some key to the system of hieroglyphs, or
some clue to the labyrinth, into which I had entered?
For hours I sat and gazed at the voiceless signs before
me, dreaming of Champollion, and the <i>Rosetta Stone</i>,
and vainly hoping that some unheard-of miracle would
be wrought in my favor, by which a single letter might
be interpreted. But the longer I gazed, the darker
became the enigma, and the more difficult seemed its
solution.</p>

<p>I had not even the foundation, upon which Dr.
Young, and Lepsius, and De Lacy, and Champollion
commenced. There were no living Copts, who spoke a
dialect of the dead tongue in which the historian had
engraved his annals. There were no descendants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the extinct nations, whose sole memorials were the
crumbling ruins before me. Time had left no teacher
whose lessons might result in success. Tradition even,
with her uncertain light, threw no flickering glare
around, by which the groping archologist might weave
an imaginary tale of the past.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I must except, however, the attempt to explore an aqueduct, which
we made together. Within, it was perfectly dark, and we could not
move without candles. The sides were of smooth stones, about four feet
high, and the roof was made by stones lapping over like the corridors
of the buildings. At a short distance from the entrance, the passage
turned to the left, and at a distance of one hundred and sixty feet it
was completely blocked up by the ruins of the roof which had fallen
down."&mdash;I<span class="smsmcap">ncidents of</span> T<span class="smsmcap">ravel in</span> C<span class="smsmcap">hiapas.</span></p>

<p>One day I had been unusually busy in arranging my
drawings and forming them into something like system,
and toward evening, had taken my seat, as I always
did, just in front of the large <i>basso-rilievo</i> ornamenting
the main entrance into the corridor of the palace, when
Pio approached me from behind and laid his hand upon
my shoulder.</p>

<p>Not having observed his approach, I was startled by
the suddenness of the contact, and sprang to my feet,
half in surprise and half in alarm. He had never before
been guilty of such an act of impoliteness, and I was on
the eve of rebuking him for his conduct, when I caught
the kind and intelligent expression of his eye, which at
once disarmed me, and attracted most strongly my
attention. Slowly raising his arm, he pointed with the
forefinger of his right hand to the entablature before
us and began to whistle most distinctly, yet most musically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
a low monody, which resembled the cadencial
rise and fall of the voice in reading poetry. Occasionally,
his tones would almost die entirely away, then
rise very high, and then modulate themselves with the
strictest regard to rhythmical measure. His finger ran
rapidly over the hieroglyphics, first from left to right,
and then from right to left.</p>

<p>In the utmost amazement I turned toward Pio, and
demanded what he meant. Is this a musical composition,
exclaimed I, that you seem to be reading? My
companion uttered no reply, but proceeded rapidly
with his task. For more than half an hour he was
engaged in whistling down the double column of hieroglyphics
engraved upon the entablature before me. So
soon as his task was accomplished, and without offering
the slightest explanation, he seized my hand and made
a signal for me to follow.</p>

<p>Having provided himself with a box of lucifer matches
and a fresh candle, he placed the same implements in
my possession, and started in advance. I obeyed almost
instinctively.</p>

<p>We passed into the innermost apartments of <i>El Palacio</i>,
and approached a cavernous opening into which Mr.
Stephens had descended, and which he supposed had
been used as a tomb.</p>

<p>It was scarcely high enough in the pitch to enable me
to stand erect, and I felt a cool damp breeze pass
over my brow, such as we sometimes encounter upon
entering a vault.</p>

<p>Pio stopped and deliberately lighted his candle and
beckoned me to do the same. As soon as this was
effected, he advanced into the darkest corner of the
dungeon, and stooping with his mouth to the floor, gave
a long, shrill whistle. The next moment, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
paving-stones was raised <i>from within</i>, and I beheld an
almost perpendicular stone staircase leading down still
deeper under ground. Calling me to his side, he
pointed to the entrance and made a gesture for me to
descend. My feelings at this moment may be better
imagined than described. My memory ran back to the
information given me by the Alcalde, that Pio was a
Carib, and I felt confident that he had confederates
close at hand. The Caribs, I well know, had never
been christianized nor subdued, but roved about the
adjacent swamps and fastnesses in their aboriginal state.
I had frequently read of terrible massacres perpetrated
by them, and the dreadful fate of William Beanham, so
thrillingly told by Mr. Stephens in his second volume,
uprose in my mind at this instant, with fearful distinctness.
But then, thought I, what motive can this poor
boy have in alluring me to ruin? What harm have I
done him? Plunder surely cannot be his object, for he
was present when I intrusted all I possessed to the care
of the Alcalde of the village. These considerations
left my mind in equal balance, and I turned around to
confront my companion, and draw a decision from the
expression of his countenance.</p>

<p>One look reassured me at once. A playful smile
wreathed his lips, and lightened over his face a gleam
of real benevolence, not unmixed, as I thought, with
pity. Hesitating no longer, I preceded him into those
realms of subterranean night. Down, down, down, I
trod, until there seemed no bottom to the echoing cavern.
Each moment the air grew heavier, and our candles
began to flicker and grow dimmer, as the impurities
of the confined atmosphere became more and more perceptible.
My head felt lighter, and began to swim.
My lungs respired with greater difficulty, and my knees
knocked and jostled, as though faint from weakness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>Still there seemed no end to the descent. Tramp,
tramp, tramp, I heard the footsteps of my guide behind
me, and I vainly explored the darkness before. At
length we reached a broad even platform, covered over
with the peculiar tiling found among these ruins. As
soon as Pio reached the landing-place, he beckoned
me to be seated on the stone steps, which I was but too
glad to do. He at once followed my example, and
seemed no less rejoiced than I that the descent had
been safely accomplished.</p>

<p>I once descended from the summit of Bunker Hill
Monument, and counted the steps, from the top to the
bottom. That number I made 465. The estimate of
the depth of this cavern, made at the time, led me to
believe that it was nearly equal to the height of that
column. But there was no railing by which to cling,
and no friend to interrupt my fall, in case of accident.
<i>Pio was behind me!</i></p>

<p>After I became somewhat rested from the fatigue,
my curiosity returned with tenfold force, and I surveyed
the apartment with real pleasure. It was perfectly
circular, and was about fifteen feet in diameter,
and ten feet high. The walls seemed to be smooth,
except a close, damp coating of moss, that age and
humidity had fastened upon them.</p>

<p>I could perceive no exit, except the one by which we
had reached it.</p>

<p>But I was not permitted to remain long in doubt on
this point; for Pio soon rose, walked to the side of the
chamber exactly opposite the stairs, whistled shrilly,
as before, and an aperture immediately manifested
itself, large enough to admit the body of a man!
Through this he crawled, and beckoned me to follow.
No sooner had I crept through the wall, than the stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
dropped from above, and closed the orifice completely.
I now found myself standing erect in what appeared to
be a subterranean aqueduct. It was precisely of the
same size, with a flat, cemented floor, shelving sides,
and circular, or rather <i>Aztec-arched</i> roof. The passage
was not straight, but wound about with frequent turnings
as far as we pursued it.</p>

<p>Why these curves were made, I never ascertained,
although afterward I gave the subject much attention.
We started down the aqueduct at a brisk pace, our
candles being frequently extinguished by fresh drafts
of air, that struck us at almost every turn. Whenever
they occurred, we paused a moment, to reillume them,
and then hastened on, as silently and swiftly as before.</p>

<p>After traversing at least five or six miles of this
passage, occasionally passing arched chambers like
that at the foot of the staircase, we suddenly reached
the termination of the aqueduct, which was an apartment
the <i>fac-simile</i> of the one at the other end of it.
Here also we observed a stone stairway, and my companion
at once began the ascent. During our journey
through the long arched way behind us, we frequently
passed through rents, made possibly by earthquakes,
and more than once were compelled to crawl through
openings half filled with rubbish, sand and stones.
Nor was the road dry in all places. Indeed, generally,
the floor was wet, and twice we forded small brooks
that ran directly across the path. Behind us, and
before, we could distinctly hear the water dripping
from the ceiling, and long before we reached the end
of the passage, our clothing had been completely saturated.
It was, therefore, with great and necessary
caution, that I followed my guide up the slippery stairs.
Our ascent was not so tedious as our descent had been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
nor was the distance apparently more than half so
great to the surface. Pio paused a moment at the
head of the stairway, extinguished his candle, and then
requested me by a gesture to do likewise. When this
was accomplished, he touched a spring and the trap-door
flew open, <i>upwards</i>. The next instant I found
myself standing in a chamber but dimly lighted from
above. We soon emerged into open daylight, and
there, for the first time since the conquest of Mexico
by Cortes, the eyes of a white man rested upon the
gigantic ruins of <i>La Casa Grande</i>.</p>

<p>These ruins are far more extensive than any yet explored
by travelers in Central America. Hitherto, they
have entirely escaped observation. The natives of the
country are not even aware of their existence, and it
will be many years before they are visited by the
curious.</p>

<p>But here they were, a solid reality! Frowning on the
surrounding gloom of the forest, and the shadows of
approaching night, they stretched out on every side,
like the bodies of dead giants slain in battle with the
Titans.</p>

<p>Daylight was nearly gone, and it soon became impossible
to see anything with distinctness. For the first
time, the peculiarity of my lonely situation forced itself
upon my attention. I was alone with the Carib boy.
I had not even brought my side-arms with me, and I
know that it was now too late to make any attempt to
escape through the forest. The idea of returning by
the subterranean aqueduct never crossed my mind as a
possibility; for my nerves flinched at the bare thought
of the shrill whistle of Pio, and the mysterious obedience
of the stones.</p>

<p>Whilst revolving these unpleasant ideas through my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
brain, the boy approached me respectfully, opened a
small knapsack that I had not before observed he carried,
and offered me some food. Hungry and fatigued
as I was, I could not eat; the same peculiar smile
passed over his features; he rose and left me for a moment,
returned, and offered me a gourd of water. After
drinking, I felt greatly refreshed, and endeavored to
draw my companion into a conversation. But all to no
purpose. He soon fell asleep, and I too, ere long,
was quietly reposing in the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>It may seem remarkable that the ruins of <i>Casa Grande</i>
have never been discovered, as yet, by professional travelers.
But it requires only a slight acquaintance with
the characteristics of the surrounding country, and a
peep into the intricacies of a tropical forest, to dispel
at once all wonder on this subject. These ruins are
situated about five miles in a westerly direction from
those known as <i>El Palacio</i>, and originally constituted
a part of the same city. They are as much more grand
and extensive than those of <i>El Palacio</i> as those are than
the remains at Uxmal, or Copan. In fact, they are
gigantic, and reminded me forcibly of the great Temple
of Karnak, on the banks of the Nile. But they lie buried
in the fastnesses of a tropical forest. One half of them
is entombed in a sea of vegetation, and it would require
a thousand men more than a whole year to clear away
the majestic groves that shoot up like sleepless sentinels
from court-yard and corridor, send their fantastic roots
into the bedchamber of royalty, and drop their annual
foliage upon pavements where princes once played in
their infancy, and courtiers knelt in their pride. A
thousand vines and parasites are climbing in every direction,
over portal and pillar, over corridor and sacrificial
shrine. So deeply shrouded in vegetation are these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
awful memorials of dead dynasties, that a traveler might
approach within a few steps of the pyramidal mound,
upon which they are built, and yet be totally unaware
of their existence. I cannot convey a better idea of the
difficulties attending a discovery and explanation of
these ruins than to quote what Mr. Stephens has said
of <i>El Palacio</i>. "The whole country for miles around
is covered by a dense forest of gigantic trees, with a
growth of brush and underwood unknown in the wooded
deserts of our own country, and impenetrable in any
direction, except by cutting away with a machete. What
lies buried in that forest it is impossible to say of my
own knowledge. Without a guide we might have gone
within a hundred feet of all the buildings without discovering
one of them."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I awoke with a start and a shudder. Something cold
and damp seemed to have touched my forehead, and left
a chill that penetrated into my brain. How long I had
been asleep, I have no means of ascertaining; but judging
from natural instinct, I presume it was near midnight
when I awoke. I turned my head toward my companion,
and felt some relief on beholding him just
where he had fallen asleep. He was breathing heavily,
and was completely buried in unconsciousness. When
I was fully aroused I felt most strangely. I had never
experienced the same sensation but once before in my
whole life, and that was whilst in company with Judge
E&mdash;&mdash; on the stone ramparts of <i>Castillo Viejo</i>.</p>

<p>I was lying flat upon my back, with my left hand resting
gently on my naked right breast, and my right hand
raised perpendicularly from my body. The arm rested
on the elbow and was completely paralyzed, or in common
parlance, asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>On opening my eyes, I observed that the full moon
was in mid-heavens, and the night almost as bright as
day. I could distinctly see the features of Pio, and even
noticed the regular rise and fall of his bosom, as the
tides of life ebbed and flowed into his lungs. The huge
old forest trees, that had been standing amid the ruins
for unnumbered centuries, loomed up into the moonshine,
hundreds of feet above me, and cast their deep
black shadows upon the pale marbles, on whose fragments
I was reposing.</p>

<p>All at once, I perceived that my hand and arm were
in rapid motion. It rested on the elbow as a fulcrum,
and swayed back and forth, round and round, with great
ease and celerity. Perfectly satisfied that it moved
without any effort of my own will, I was greatly puzzled
to arrive at any satisfactory solution of the phenomenon.
The idea crossed my mind that the effect was of <i>spiritual</i>
origin, and that I had become self-magnetized. I had
read and believed that the two sides of the human frame
are differently electrified, and the curious phases of
the disease called <i>paralysis</i> sufficiently established the
dogma, that one half the body may die, and yet the
other half live on. I had many times experimented on
the human hand, and the philosophical fact had long
been demonstrated, to my own satisfaction, that the inside
of the hand is totally different from the outside. If
we desire to ascertain the temperature of any object, we
instinctively touch it with the inside of the fingers; on
the contrary, if we desire to ascertain our own temperature,
we do so by laying the back of the hand upon
some isolated and indifferent object. Convinced, therefore,
that the right and left sides of the human body are
differently magnetized, I was not long in finding a solution
of the peculiar phenomenon, which at first astonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
me so greatly. In fact, my body had become an
electrical machine, and by bringing the two poles into
contact, as was affected by linking my right and left sides
together, by means of my left hand, a battery had been
formed, and the result was, the paralysis or magnetization
of my right arm and hand, such being precisely
the effect caused by a <i>spiritual circle</i>,&mdash;as it has been
denominated. My arm and hand represented, in all
respects, a table duly charged, and the same phenomenon
could be produced, if I was right in my
conjectures.</p>

<p>Immediately, therefore, I set about testing the truth
of this hypothesis. I asked, half aloud, if there were
any spirits present. My hand instantly closed, except
the forefinger, and gave three distinctive jerks that
almost elevated my elbow from its position. A negative
reply was soon given to a subsequent question by a
single jerk of the hand; and thus I was enabled to hold
a conversation in monosyllables with my invisible companions.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to detail the whole of the interview
which followed. I will only add that portion of it
which is intimately connected with this narrative.
Strange as it may appear, I had until this moment forgotten
all about the beautiful apparition that appeared
and disappeared so mysteriously at <i>Castillo Viejo</i>. All
at once, however, the recollection revived, and I remembered
the promise contained in the single word she
murmured, "Palenque!"</p>

<p>Overmastering my excitement, I whispered:</p>

<p>"Beautiful spirit, that once met me on the ramparts
where Lord Nelson fought and conquered, art thou
here?"</p>

<p>An affirmative reply.</p>

<p>"Will you appear and redeem your promise?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>Suddenly, the branches of the neighboring trees
waved and nodded; the cold marbles about me seemed
animated with life, and crashed and struck each other
with great violence; the old pyramid trembled to
its centre, as if shaken by an earthquake; and the forest
around moaned as though a tempest was sweeping by.
At the same instant, full in the bright moonlight, and
standing within three paces of my feet, appeared the
Aztec Princess, whose waving <i>panache</i>, flowing garments
and benignant countenance had bewildered me many
months before, on the moss-grown parapet of <i>Castillo
Viejo</i>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Was I dreaming, or was the vision real, that my eyes
beheld? This was the first calm thought that coursed
through my brain, after the terror and amazement had
subsided. Awe-struck I certainly was, when the beautiful
phantom first rose upon my sight, at Castillo; awe-struck
once more, when she again appeared, amid the
gray old rains of <i>Casa Grande</i>. I have listened very
often to the surmises of others, as they detailed what
<i>they</i> would do, were a supernatural being to rise up
suddenly before them. Some have said, they would
gaze deliberately into the face of the phantom, scan its
every feature, and coolly note down, for the benefit of
others, how long it "walked," and in what manner it
faded from the sight. The nerves of these very men
trembled while they spoke, and had an apparition burst
at that instant into full view, these heroes in imagination
would have crouched and hid their faces, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
teeth chattering with terror, and their hearts beating
their swelling sides, as audibly as the convict hears his
own when the hangman draws the black cap over his
unrepentant head.</p>

<p>I blame no man for yielding to the dictates of Nature.
He is but a fool who feels no fear, and hears not a warning
in the wind, observes not a sign in the heavens, and
perceives no admonition in the air, when hurricanes are
brooding, clouds are gathering, or earthquakes muttering
in his ears. The sane mind listens, and thwarts
danger by its apprehensions.</p>

<p>The true hero is not the man who knows no fear&mdash;for
that were idiotic&mdash;but he who sees it, and escapes it, or
meets it bravely. Was it courage in the elder Pliny to
venture so closely to the crater of Vesuvius, whilst in
eruption, that he lost his life? How can man make war
with the elements, or battle with his God?</p>

<p>There is, in the secret chambers of every human heart,
one dark weird cell, over whose portal is inscribed&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mystery</span>.
There Superstition sits upon her throne;
there Idolatry shapes her monsters, and there Religion
reveals her glories. Within that cell, the soul communes
with itself most intimately, confesses its midnight
cowardice, and in low whispers mutters its dread
of the supernatural.</p>

<p>All races, all nations, and all times have felt its influences,
oozing like imperceptible dews from the mouth
of that dark cavern.</p>

<p>Vishnu heard its deep mutterings in the morning of
our race, and they still sound hollow but indistinct, like
clods upon a coffin-lid, along the wave of each generation,
as it rises and rolls into the past. Plato and Numa
and Cicero and Brutus listened to its prophetic cadences,
as they fell upon their ears. Mohammed heard them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
his cave, Samuel Johnson in his bed. Poets have caught
them in the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shivering whisper of startled leaves,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>martyrs in the crackling faggots, heroes amid the din
of battle.</p>

<p>If you ask, what means this voice? I reply,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A solemn murmur in the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Tells of the world to be</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As travelers hear the billows roll<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Before they reach the sea."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let no man, therefore, boast that he has no dread of
the supernatural. When mortal can look spirit in the
face, without blanching, man will be immortal.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To convince myself that I did not dream, I rose upon
my elbow, and reclined for a moment in that attitude.
Gradually I gained my feet, and then stood confronting
the Aztec maiden. The midnight breeze of the tropics
had set in, and by the clear moonlight I distinctly saw
the <i>panache</i> of feathers that she wore upon her head
swaying gracefully upon the air.</p>

<p>Convinced now, beyond all doubt, that the scene was
real, the ruling desire of my life came back in full force
upon me, and I spoke, in a hoarse whisper, the following
words:</p>

<p>"Here lies a buried realm; I would be its historian!"</p>

<p>The apparition, without any reply in words, glided
toward me, and approached so close that I could easily
have touched her had I dared. But a sense of propriety
subdued all unhallowed curiosity, and I determined
to submit passively to all that my new friend should do.
This state of mind seemed at once known to her, for
she smiled approvingly, and came still nearer to where
I stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>Elevating her beautiful arm, she passed it gently over
my face, her hand just touching my features, and imparting
a cool sensation to my skin. I distinctly remember
that the hand felt damp. No sooner was this
done than my nervous system seemed to be restored to
its usual tone, and every sensation of alarm vanished.</p>

<p>My brain began to feel light and swimmy, and my
whole frame appeared to be losing its weight. This
peculiar sensation gradually increased in intensity until
full conviction flashed upon me that I could, by an
effort of will, rise into the air, and fly with all the ease
and rapidity of an eagle.</p>

<p>The idea was no sooner fully conceived, than I noticed
a wavy, unsteady motion in the figure of the Aztec Princess,
and almost immediately afterwards, I perceived
that she was gradually rising from the broken pavement
upon which she had been standing, and passing slowly
upwards through the branches of the overshadowing
trees. What was most remarkable, the relative distance
between us did not seem to increase, and my amazement
was inconceivable, when on casting my eyes
toward my feet, I perceived that I was elevated more
than twenty yards from the pavement where I had slept.</p>

<p>My ascent had been so gradual, that I was entirely
unaware of moving, and now that I became sensible of
it, the motion itself was still imperceptible. Upward,
still upward, I was carried, until the tallest limbs of the
loftiest trees had been left far below me. Still the
ascent continued. A wide and beautiful panorama now
opened before me. Above, all was flashing moonlight
and starry radiance. The beams of the full moon grew
more brilliant as we cleared the vapory atmosphere
contiguous to the earth, until they shone with half the
splendor of morn, and glanced upon the features of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
companion with a mellow sheen, that heightened a
thousandfold her supermundane beauty. Below, the
gray old relics of a once populous capital glimmered
spectrally in the distance, looking like tombs, shrouded
by a weeping forest; whilst one by one, the mourners
lost their individuality, and ere long presented but a
dark mass of living green. After having risen several
hundred feet perpendicularly, I was enabled to form an
estimate of the extent of the forest, in the bosom of
which sleep and moulder the monuments of the aboriginal
Americans. There is no such forest existing elsewhere
on the surface of this great globe. It has no
parallel in nature. The Black Forest of Germany, the
Thuringian Forest of Saxony, the Cross Timbers of
Texas, the dense and inaccessible woods cloaking the
headwaters of the Amazon and the La Plata, are mere
parks in comparison. For miles and miles, leagues and
leagues, it stretched out&mdash;north, south, east and west.
It covers an area larger than the island of Great Britain;
and throughout this immense extent of country there is
but one mountain chain, and but one river. The summits
of this range have been but seldom seen by white
men, and have never been scaled. The river drains the
whole territory, but loses itself in a terrific marsh before
its tide reaches the Mexican gulf, toward which it runs.
The current is exceedingly rapid; and, after passing for
hundreds of miles under the land and under the sea, it
unites its submarine torrent near the west end of Cuba,
with that of the Orinoco and the Amazon, and thus
forms that great oceanic river called the Gulf Stream.
Professor Maury was right in his philosophic conjecture
as to the origin of that mighty and resistless tide.</p>

<p>Having attained a great height perpendicularly above
the spot of our departure, we suddenly dashed off with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the speed of an express locomotive, toward the northeast.</p>

<p>Whither we were hastening, I knew not; nor did I
trouble my mind with any useless conjectures. I felt
secure in the power of my companion, and sure of her
protection. I knew that by some unaccountable process
she had neutralized the gravitating force of a
material body, had elevated me hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of feet in the atmosphere, and by some
mysterious charm was attracting me toward a distant
bourne. Years before, whilst a medical student at the
University of Louisiana, the professor of <i>materia medica</i>
had opened his course of lectures with an inquiry into
the origin and essence of gravitation, and I had listened
respectfully, but at that time doubtingly, to the theory
he propounded. He stated that it was not unphilosophical
to believe that the time would arrive when the
gravitating power of dense bodies would be overcome,
and balloons constructed to navigate the air with the
same unerring certainty that ships traversed the ocean.</p>

<p>He declared that gravitation itself was not a <i>cause</i>
but an <i>effect;</i> that it might be produced by the rotation
of the earth upon its axis, or by some undiscovered
current of electricity, or by some recondite and hitherto
undetected agent or force in nature. Magnetism he
thought a species of electricity, and subsequent investigations
have convinced me that <i>sympathy</i> or <i>animal
magnetism</i> was akin to the same parent power. By
means of this latter agent I had seen the human body
rendered so light that two persons could raise it with a
single finger properly applied. More than this, I had
but recently witnessed at Castillo, dead matter clothed
with life and motion, and elevated several feet into the
air without the aid of any human agency. This age I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
knew well to be an age of wonders. Nature was yielding
up her secrets on every hand; the boundary between
the natural and the spiritual had been broken down;
new worlds were flashing upon the eyes of the followers
of Galileo almost nightly from the ocean depths of
space. Incalculable treasures had been discovered in
the most distant ends of the earth, and I, unlettered
hind that I was, did not presume to limit the power of
the great Creator, and because an act seemed impossible
to my narrow vision, and within my limited experience,
to cry aloud, <i>imposture</i>, or to mutter sneeringly,
<i>insanity</i>.</p>

<p>Before proceeding farther with the thread of this
narrative, the attention of the reader is solicited to the
careful perusal of the following extracts from Stephens's
<i>Travels in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan</i>, published
at New York in 1841.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But the Padre told us more; something that increased
our excitement to the highest pitch. On the other side of
the great traversing range of Cordilleras lies the district of
Vera Paz, once called Tierra de Guerra, or land of war,
from the warlike character of its aboriginal inhabitants.
Three times the Spaniards were driven back in their attempt
to conquer it.<a name="FNanchor_A-133_2" id="FNanchor_A-133_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A-133_2" class="fnanchor">[A-133]</a></p>

<p>The rest of the Tierra de Guerra never was conquered;
and at this day the northeastern section bounded by the
range of the Cordilleras and the State of Chiapa is occupied
by Cadones, or unbaptized Indians, who live as their
fathers did, acknowledging no submission to the Spaniards,
and the government of Central America does not pretend
to exercise any control over them. But the thing that
roused us was the assertion by the Padre that four days on
the road to Mexico, on the other side of the Great Sierra,
was a L<span class="smsmcap">iving</span> C<span class="smsmcap">ity</span>, large and populous, occupied by Indians,
precisely in the same state as before the discovery of America.
He had heard of it many years before, at the village of
Chajal, and was told by the villagers that from the topmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
ridge of the Sierra this city was distinctly visible. He was
then young, and with much labor climbed to the naked
summit of the Sierra, from which, at a height of ten or
twelve thousand feet, he looked over an immense plain extending
to Yucatan and the Gulf of Mexico, and saw at a
great distance a large city, spread over a great space, and
with turrets white and glittering in the sun. The traditionary
account of the Indians of Chajal is, that no white man
has ever reached the city; that the inhabitants speak the
Maya language; are aware that a race of strangers has conquered
the whole country around, and murder any white
man who attempts to enter their territory. They have no
coin or other circulating medium; no horses, cattle, mules,
or other domestic animals, except fowls, and the cocks they
keep under ground to prevent their crowing being heard.<a name="FNanchor_B-134_3" id="FNanchor_B-134_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_B-134_3" class="fnanchor">[B-134]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p>Mr. Stephens then adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One look at that city is worth ten years of an every-day
life. If he is right, a place is left where Indians and an
Indian city exist as Cortez and Alvarado found them.
There are living men who can solve the mystery that hangs
over the ruined cities of America; perhaps, who can go to
Copan and Palenque and read the inscriptions on their monuments.</p></div>

<p class="center"><span style="letter-spacing: 2em;">**********</span></p>

<p>The moon, long past the meridian, was sinking
slowly to her western goal, whilst the east was already
beginning to blush and redden with the dawn. Before
us rose high and clear three distinct mountain peaks,
covered with a mantle of snow. I began to tremble
with cold. But our pace did not slacken, nor our altitude
diminish. On the contrary, we began to rise
gradually, until we found ourselves nearly upon a level
with the three peaks. Selecting an opening or gap
betwixt the two westernmost, we glided through like
the wind. I shivered and my teeth chattered as we
skimmed along those everlasting snows. Here, thought
I, the condor builds his nest in summer, and the avalanches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
find a home. The eagle's wing has not strength
enough to battle with this thin and freezing atmosphere,
and no living thing but "the proud bird, the
condor of the Andes," ever scaled these hoary summits.
But our descent had already commenced. Gradually,
as the morning broke, the region of ice and snow was
left behind us, and just as the first ray of the rising
sun shot over the peaks we had but a moment before
surmounted, I beheld, glittering in the dim and shadowy
distance, the white walls of a magnificent city. An
exclamation of surprise and pleasure involuntarily
escaped my lips; but one glance at my companion
checked all further utterance. She raised her rounded
forefinger to her lip, and made a gesture, whose purport
I well understood.</p>

<p>We swept over forests and cornfields and vineyards,
the city growing upon the vision every moment, and
rising like the Mexican capital, when first beheld by
Europeans from the bosom of a magnificent lake.
Finally, we found ourselves immediately above it, and
almost at the same moment, began to descend. In a
few seconds I stood alone, in a large open space, surrounded
upon all sides by lofty stone edifices, erected
upon huge pyramidal structures, that resembled the
forest-covered mounds at Palenque. The day had fully
dawned, but I observed no inhabitants. Presently a
single individual appeared upon one of the towers near
me, and gave a loud, shrill whistle, such as we sometimes
hear in crowded theatres. In an instant it was
echoed and re-echoed a thousand times, upon every
side, and immediately the immense city seemed to be
awake, as if by magic. They poured by thousands
into the open square, where I stood petrified with
astonishment. Before me, like a vision of midnight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
marched by, in almost countless throngs, battalion on
battalion of a race of men deemed and recorded extinct
by the wisest historians.</p>

<p>They presented the most picturesque appearance
imaginable, dressed apparently in holiday attire, and
keeping step to a low air, performed on instruments
emitting a dull, confused sound, that seldom rose so as
to be heard at any great distance.</p>

<p>They continued promenading the square, until the
first level ray of sunshine fell upon the great Teocallis&mdash;as
it was designated by the Spaniards&mdash;then with
unanimous action they fell upon their faces, striking
their foreheads three times upon the mosaic pavement.
Just as they rose to their feet, I observed four persons,
most gorgeously dressed, descending the steps of the
Temple, bearing a palanquin, in which sat a single individual.
My attention was at once arrested by her
appearance, for she was a woman. She was arrayed in
a <i>panache</i>, or head-dress, made entirely of the plumage
of the <i>Quezale</i>, the royal bird of Quiche. It was by far
the most tasteful and becoming ornament to the head I
ever beheld, besides being the most magnificent. It is
impossible to describe the graceful movement of those
waving plumes, as they were stirred by the slightest
inclination of the head, or the softest aspiration of the
breeze. But the effect was greatly heightened by the
constant change of color which they underwent. Blue
and crimson, and orange and gold, were so blended that
the eye was equally dazzled and delighted. But the
utmost astonishment pervaded me, when, upon closely
scrutinizing her features, I thought I recognized the
beautiful face of the Aztec Princess. Little leisure,
however, was afforded me for this purpose, for no sooner
had her subjects, the assembled thousands, bowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
deferential respect to their sovereign, than a company
of drilled guards marched up to where I stood, and
unresistingly made me prisoner.</p>

<p>It is useless to attempt a full description of the imposing
ceremony I had witnessed, or to portray the
appearance of those who took the most prominent parts.
Their costume corresponded precisely with that of the
figures in <i>bas-relief</i> on the sculptured monuments at
Palenque. Each wore a gorgeous head-dress, generally
of feathers, carried an instrument decorated with ribbons,
feathers and skins, which appeared to be a war-club,
and wore huge sashes of yellow, green, or crimson
cotton cloth, knotted before and behind, and falling in
graceful folds almost to the ground.</p>

<p>Hitherto not a word had been spoken. The ceremony
I had witnessed was a religious one, and was at once
interpreted by me to be the worship of the sun. I
remembered well that the ancient Peruvians were heliolaters,
and my imagination had been dazzled when but
a child by the gorgeous description given by the historian
Robertson, of the great Temple of the Sun at
Cuzco. There the Incas had worshiped the God of
Day from the period when Manco Capac came from the
distant Island of Oello, and taught the native Indians
the rudiments of civilization, until the life of the last
scion of royal blood was sacrificed to the perfidy of the
Spanish invaders. These historical facts had long been
familiar to my mind; but I did not recollect any facts
going to show that the ancient Aztecs were likewise
heliolaters; but further doubt was now impossible.</p>

<p>In perfect silence I was hurried up the stone steps of
the great Teocallis, toward the palace erected upon its
summit, into whose broad and lofty corridors we soon
entered. These we traversed in several directions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
leaving the more outward and gradually approaching
the heart or central apartments.</p>

<p>Finally, I was ushered into one of the most magnificently
decorated audience-chambers that the eye of man
ever beheld.</p>

<p>We were surrounded by immense tablets of <i>bas-reliefs</i>
sculptured in white and black marble, and presenting,
evidently, a connected history of the ancient heroes of
the race. Beside each tablet triple rows of hieroglyphics
were carved in the solid stone, unquestionably
giving in detail the history of the hero or chief whose
likeness stood near them. Many of these appeared to
be females, but, judging from the sceptre each carried,
I was persuaded that the old <i>Salique</i> law of France and
other European nations never was acknowledged by the
aboriginal Americans.</p>

<p>The roof was high, and decorated with the plumage
of the Quezale and other tropical birds, whilst a throne
was erected in the centre of the apartment, glittering
in gold and silver ornaments, hung about with beautiful
shells, and lined with the skins of the native leopard,
prepared in the most exquisite style.</p>

<p>Seated upon a throne, I recognized the princess whose
morning devotions I had just witnessed. At a gesture,
I was carried up close to the foot of the throne.</p>

<p>After closely inspecting her features, I satisfied myself
that she was not the companion of my mysterious
journey, being several years older in appearance, and
of a darker complexion. Still, there was a very striking
resemblance between them, and it was evident that
they not only belonged to the same race, but to the
same family. I looked up at her with great respect,
anticipating some encouraging word or sign. But
instead of speaking, she commenced a low, melodious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
whistle, eying me intently during the whole time.
Ceasing, she evidently anticipated some reply on my
part, and I at once accosted her in the following terms:</p>

<p>"Most beautiful Princess, I am not voluntarily an invader
of your realm. I was transported hither in a
manner as mysterious as it was unexpected. Teach me
but to read these hieroglyphics, and I will quit your
territories forever."</p>

<p>A smile flitted across the features of the Princess as I
uttered these words; and she gave an order, by a sharp
whistle, to an officer that stood near, who immediately
disappeared. In a few moments, he returned, bringing
with him a native dressed very coarsely in white cotton
cloth, and who carried an empty jar, or water tank, upon
his head. He was evidently a laborer, and, judging
from the low obeisances he constantly made, much to
the amusement of the courtiers standing around, I am
satisfied that he never before in his whole life had been
admitted to the presence of his sovereign.</p>

<p>Making a gesture to the officer who had introduced
him, he spoke a few low words to the native, who immediately
turned toward me, and uttered, slowly and
distinctly, the following sentence:</p>

<p>"Ix-itl hua-atl zi-petl poppicobatl."</p>

<p>I shook my head despairingly. Several other attempts
to communicate with me were made, both by
the Princess and the interpreter, but all to no purpose.
I could neither understand the melodies nor the jargon.
But I noticed throughout all these proceedings that there
seemed to be two entirely distinct modes of expression;
the first by whistling, and the second by utterance.
The idea at once flashed across my mind, that there
were two languages used in the country&mdash;one sacred to
the blood royal and the nobility, and the other used by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the common people. Impressed with this thought, I
immediately set about verifying it by experiment.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to detail the ingenious methods I
devised to ascertain this fact. It is sufficient for the
present purposes of this narrative to state, that, during
the day, I was abundantly satisfied with the truth of my
surmise; and that, before night, I learned another fact,
equally important, that the hieroglyphics were written
in the royal tongue, and could be read only by those
connected by ties of blood with the reigning family.</p>

<p>There was at first something ludicrous in the idea of
communicating thought by sound emitted in the way indicated
above. In my wildest dreams, the notion of
such a thing being possible had never occurred to my
imagination. And when the naked fact was now demonstrated
to me every moment, I could scarcely credit
my senses. Still, when I reflected that night upon it,
after I retired to rest, the system did not appear unnatural,
nor even improbable. Birds, I knew, made use of
the same musical tongue; and when but a boy, on the
shores of the distant Albemarle, I had often listened,
till long after midnight, to the wonderful loquacity of
the common mocking-bird, as she poured forth her
summer strains. Who has not heard the turtle dove
wooing her mate in tones that were only not human,
because they were more sadly beautiful? Many a belated
traveler has placed his hand upon his sword-hilt,
and looked suspiciously behind him, as the deep bass
note of the owl has startled the dewy air. The cock's
crow has become a synonym for a pan of triumph.</p>

<p>Remembering all those varieties in sound that the air
is capable of, when <i>cut</i>, as it were, by whistling, I no
longer doubted that a language could easily be constructed
by analyzing the several tones and giving value
to their different modulations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>The ludicrousness of the idea soon gave place to
admiration, and before I had been domiciliated in the
palace of the Princess a month, I had become perfectly
infatuated with her native language, and regarded it as
the most beautiful and expressive ever spoken by man.
And now, after several years have elapsed since its melodious
accents have fallen upon my ears, I hesitate not to
assert that for richness and variety of tone, for force and
depth of expression, for harmony and sweetness&mdash;in
short, for all those characteristics that give beauty and
strength to spoken thought&mdash;the royal tongue of the
aboriginal Americans is without a rival.</p>

<p>For many days after my mysterious appearance in
the midst of the great city I have described, my fate
still hung in the balance. I was examined and re-examined
a hundred times as to the mode of my
entrance into the valley; but I always persisted in
making the same gestures, and pointed to the sky as
the region whence I had descended. The guards stationed
at every avenue of entrance and exit were
summoned to the capital, and questioned closely as to
the probability of my having passed them unawares;
but they fully exculpated themselves from all blame,
and were restored to their forfeited posts.</p>

<p>Gradually the excitement in the city subsided, and
one by one the great nobles were won over to credit the
story of my celestial arrival in their midst, and I
believed the great object of my existence in a fair way
to be accomplished.</p>

<p>Every facility was afforded me to learn the royal
tongue, and after a little more than a year's residence
in the palace, I spoke it with considerable fluency and
accuracy.</p>

<p>But all my efforts hitherto were vain to obtain a key<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to the hieroglyphics. Not only was the offense capital
to teach their alphabet to a stranger, but equally so to
natives themselves, unconnected with the blood royal.
With all my ingenuity and industry, I had not advanced
a single letter.</p>

<p>One night, as I lay tossing restlessly upon my bed,
revolving this insoluble enigma in my mind, one of the
mosaic paving-stones was suddenly lifted up in the
middle of the room, and the figure of a young man with
a lighted taper in his hand stood before me.</p>

<p>Raising my head hastily from the pillow, I almost
sank back with astonishment when I recognized in the
form and features of my midnight visitor, Pio the Carib
boy.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />
<p class="secsc">CHAPTER V.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</span><br />
<span class="i0h">Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."</span><br />
<br />
<span class="i15">&mdash;S<span class="smsmcap">hakspeare.</span></span><br />
</div></div>


<p>I sprang to my feet with all the eagerness of joy, and
was about to rush into the arms of Pio, when he suddenly
checked my enthusiasm by extinguishing the
light. I stood still and erect, like one petrified into
stone. That moment I felt a hand upon my arm, then
around my waist, and ere I could collect my thoughts,
was distinctly lifted from the ground. But I was
carried only a few steps. On touching the floor with
my feet, I was planted firmly, and the arms of my companion
were tightly drawn around my own so as to
prevent me from raising them. The next instant, and
the stone upon which we stood suddenly slid from its
position, and gradually sank perpendicularly,&mdash;we still
retaining our position upon it.</p>

<p>Our descent was not rapid, nor did I deem it very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
secure; for the trap-door trembled under us, and more
than once seemed to touch the shaft into which we were
descending. A few moments more and we landed
securely upon a solid pavement. My companion then
disengaged his hold, and stepping off a few paces, pronounced
the words "<i>We are here!</i>" in the royal tongue,
and immediately a panel slid from the side of the apartment,
and a long passage-way, lighted at the further
end by a single candle, displayed itself to view. Into
that passage we at once entered, and without exchanging
a single word, walked rapidly toward the light.</p>

<p>The light stood upon a stone stand about four feet
high, at the intersection of these passages. We took the
one to the left, and advanced twenty or thirty yards,
when Pio halted. On coming up to him, he placed his
mouth close to the wall, and exclaimed as before. "We
are here." A huge block of granite swung inward,
and we entered a small but well-lighted apartment,
around which were hanging several costly and magnificent
suits of Palenquin costume.</p>

<p>Hastily seizing two of them, Pio commenced arraying
himself in one, and requested me by a gesture to don
the other. With a little assistance, I soon found myself
decked from head to foot in a complete suit of regal
robes&mdash;<i>panache</i>, sash, and sandals inclusive.</p>

<p>When all was completed, Pio, for the first time, addressed
me as follows: "Young stranger, whoever you
may be, or to whatever nation you may belong, matters
but little to me. The attendant guardian spirit of our
race and country has conducted you hither, in the most
mysterious manner, and now commands me to have you
instructed in the most sacred lore of the Aztecs. Your
long residence in this palace has fully convinced you of
the danger to which we are both exposed; I in revealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and you in acquiring the key to the interpretation
of the historical records of my country. I need not
assure you that our lives are both forfeited, should the
slightest suspicion be aroused in the breasts of the
Princess or the nobility.</p>

<p>"You are now dressed in the appropriate costume of
a student of our literature, and must attend me nightly
at the gathering of the Queen's kindred to be instructed
in the art. Express no surprise at anything you see or
hear; keep your face concealed as much as possible,
fear nothing, and follow me."</p>

<p>At a preconcerted signal given by Pio, a door flew
open and we entered the vestibule of a large and brilliantly
illuminated chamber.</p>

<p>As soon as we passed the entrance I saw before me
not less than two hundred young persons of both sexes,
habited in the peculiar garb of students, like our own.
We advanced slowly and noiselessly, until we reached
two vacant places, prepared evidently beforehand for
us. Our entrance was not noticed by the classes, nor
by those whom I afterwards recognized as teachers.
All seemed intent upon the problem before them, and
evinced no curiosity to observe the new comers. My
own curiosity at this moment was intense, and had it
not been for the prudent cautions constantly given me
by Pio, by touching my robes or my feet, an exposure
most probably would have occurred the first night of my
initiation, and the narrative of these adventures never
been written.</p>

<p>My presence of mind, however, soon came to my
assistance, and before the evening was over, I had, by
shrewdly noticing the conduct of others, shaped my own
into perfect conformity with theirs, and rendered detection
next to impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>It now becomes necessary to digress a moment from
the thread of my story, and give an accurate description
of the persons I beheld around me, the chamber
in which we were gathered, and the peculiar mode of
instruction pursued by the sages.</p>

<p>The scholars were mostly young men and women,
averaging in age about twenty years. They all wore the
emblem of royalty, which I at once recognized in the
<i>panache</i> of Quezale plumes that graced their heads.
They stood in semi-circular rows, the platform rising as
they receded from the staging in front, like seats in an
amphitheatre. Upon the stage were seated five individuals&mdash;two
of the male, and three of the female sex.
An old man was standing up, near the edge of the stage,
holding in his hands two very cunningly-constructed
instruments. At the back of the stage, a very large,
smooth tablet of black marble was inserted in the wall,
and a royal personage stood near it, upon one side, with
a common piece of chalk in his right hand, and a cotton
napkin in the left. This reminded me but too truthfully
of the fourth book of Euclid and Nassau Hall; and I
was again reminded of the great mathematician before
the assembly broke up, and of his reply to that King of
Sicily, who inquired if there were no easy way of acquiring
mathematics. "None, your Highness," replied
the philosopher; "there is no royal road to learning."
Labor, I soon found, was the only price, even amongst
the Aztecs, at which knowledge could be bought. Each
student was furnished with the same species of instruments
which the old man before-mentioned held in his
hands.</p>

<p>The one held in the left hand resembled a white porcelain
slate, only being much larger than those in common
use. It was nearly twenty inches square, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
divided by mathematical lines into thirty-six compartments.
It was covered over with a thin crystal, resembling
glass, which is found in great quantities in the
neighboring mountains, and is perfectly transparent.
The crystal was raised about the one eighth of an inch
from the surface of the slate, and allowed a very fine
species of black sand to move at will between them.
The instrument carried in the right hand resembled
the bow of a common violin, more than anything else.
The outer edge was constructed of a beautiful yellow
wood, polished, and bent into the arc of a quarter
circle; whilst a mass of small cords, made of the native
hemp, united the two ends.</p>

<p>The method of using the bow was this: The slate
was shaken violently once or twice, so as to distribute
the black sand equally over the white surface, and then
the bow was drawn perpendicularly down the edge of
the slate, very rapidly, so as to produce a quick whistling
sound. The effect produced upon the grains of
sand was truly wonderful to the uninitiated in the laws
of acoustics. They arranged themselves into peculiar
figures, sometimes in the form of a semicircle, sometimes
into that of a spiral, sometimes into a perfect
circle, or a cone, or a rhomboid, or an oval, dependent
entirely upon two things: first, the place where the
slate was held by the left hand; and second, the point
where the bow was drawn across the edge. As the
slate was subdivided into thirty-six compartments, by
either one of which it could be held, and as there was a
corresponding point, across which the bow could be
drawn, there were seventy-two primitive sounds that
might be produced by means of this simple contrivance.
Each of these sounds inherently and necessarily produced
a different figure upon the slate, and there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
consequently just seventy-two initial letters in the Aztec
alphabet.</p>

<p>The mode of instruction was extremely simple. A
word was pronounced by the aged teacher at the front
of the stage, written upon his slate, exhibited to the
scholar at the black tablet, and by him copied upon it.
The whole class then drew down their bows, so as to
produce the proper sound, and the word itself, or its
initial letter, was immediately formed upon the slate.</p>

<p>After the seventy-two primitive letters or sounds had
been learned, the next step was the art of combining
them, so as not only to produce single words, but very
often whole sentences. Thus the first hieroglyphic
carved upon the tablet, on the back wall of the altar,
in Casa No. 3 (forming the frontispiece of the second
volume of Stephens's Travels in Central America), expresses,
within itself, the name, date of birth, place of
nativity, and parentage, of <i>Xixencotl</i>, the first king of
the twenty-third dynasty of the Aztecs.</p>

<p>The hieroglyphics of the Aztecs are all of them both
symbolical and phonetic. Hence, in almost every one
we observe, first, the primitive sound or initial letter,
and its various combinations; and, secondly, some symbolic
drawing, as a human face, for instance, or an
eagle's bill, or a fish, denoting some peculiar characteristic
of the person or thing delineated.</p>

<p>But to return to the Hall of Students. The men and
women on the stage were placed there as critics upon
the pronunciation of each articulate sound. They were
selected from the wisest men and best elocutionists in
the kingdom, and never failed to detect the slightest
error in the pronunciation of the tutor.</p>

<p>The royal tongue of the Aztecs is the only one now in
existence that is based upon natural philosophy and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
laws of sound. It appeals both to the eye and ear of
the speaker, and thus the nicest shades of thought may
be clearly expressed. There is no such thing as <i>stilted</i>
language amongst them, and logomachy is unknown.</p>

<p>And here I may be permitted to observe that a wider
field for research and discovery lies open in the domain
of <i>sound</i> than in any other region of science. The laws
of harmony, even, are but imperfectly understood, and
the most accomplished musicians are mere tyros in the
great science of acoustics. There is every reason to
believe that there is an intimate but yet undiscovered
link between <i>number</i>, <i>light</i>, and <i>sound</i> whose solution
will astonish and enlighten the generations that are to
succeed our own. <i>When God spake the worlds into being,
the globular form they assumed was not accidental, nor arbitrary,
but depended essentially upon the tone of the great
Architect, and the medium in which it resounded.</i></p>

<p>Let the natural philosophers of the rising generation
direct their especial attention toward the fields I have
indicated, and the rewards awaiting their investigations
will confer upon them immortality of fame.</p>

<p>There is a reason why the musical scale should not
mount in whole tones up to the octave; why the mind
grasps decimals easier than vulgar fractions, and why,
by the laws of light, the blood-red tint should be heavier
than the violet. Let Nature, in these departments,
be studied with the same care that Cuvier explored the
organization of insects, that Liebig deduced the property
of acids, and that Leverrier computed the orbit of
that unseen world which his genius has half created,
and all the wonderful and beautiful secrets now on the
eve of bursting into being from the dark domain of
sound, color, and shape, will at once march forth into
view, and take their destined places in the ranks of
human knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Then the science of computation will be intuitive, as
it was in the mind of Zerah Colburn; the art of music
creative, as in the plastic voices of Jehovah; and the
great principles of light and shape and color divine,
as in the genius of Swedenborg and the imagination of
Milton.</p>

<p>I have now completed the outline of the sketch,
which in the foregoing pages I proposed to lay before
the world.</p>

<p>The peculiar circumstances which led me to explore
the remains of the aboriginal Americans, the adventures
attending me in carrying out that design, the mode
of my introduction into the Living City, spoken of by
Stephens, and believed in by so many thousands of
enlightened men, and above all, the wonderful and
almost incredible character of the people I there encountered,
together with a rapid review of their language
and literature, have been briefly but faithfully
presented to the public.</p>

<p>It but remains for me now to present my readers
with a few specimens of Aztec literature, translated
from the hieroglyphics now mouldering amid the forests
of Chiapa; to narrate the history of my escape from
the Living City of the aborigines; to bespeak a friendly
word for the forthcoming history of one of the earliest,
most beautiful, and unfortunate of the Aztec queens,
copied <i>verbatim</i> from the annals of her race, and to bid
them one and all, for the present, a respectful adieu.</p>

<p>Before copying from the blurred and water-soaked
manuscript before me, a single extract from the literary
remains of the monumental race amongst whom I have
spent three years and a half of my early manhood, it
may not be deemed improper to remark that a large
work upon this subject is now in course of publication,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
containing the minutest details of the domestic life,
public institutions, language, and laws of that interesting
people.</p>

<p>The extracts I present to the reader may be relied
upon as exactly correct, since they are taken from the
memoranda made upon the spot.</p>

<p>Directly in front of the throne, in the great audience-chamber
described in the preceding chapter, and written
in the most beautiful hieroglyphic extant, I found
the following account of the origin of the land:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Great Spirit, whose emblem is the sun, held the
water-drops out of which the world was made, in the hollow
of his hand. He breathed a tone, and they rounded into
the great globe, and started forth on the errand of counting
up the years.</p>

<p>Nothing existed but water and the great fishes of the sea.
One eternity passed. The Great Spirit sent a solid star,
round and beautiful, but dead and no longer burning, and
plunged it into the depths of the oceans. Then the winds
were born, and the rains began to fall. The animals next
sprang into existence. They came up from the star-dust
like wheat and maize. The round star floated upon the
waters, and became the dry land; and the land was high,
and its edges steep. It was circular, like a plate, and all
connected together.</p>

<p>The marriage of the land and the sea produced man, but
his spirit came from the beams of the sun.</p>

<p>Another eternity passed away, and the earth became too
full of people. They were all white, because the star fell
into the cold seas, and the sun could not darken their complexions.</p>

<p>Then the sea bubbled up in the middle of the land, and
the country of the Aztecs floated off to the west. Wherever
the star cracked open, there the waters rose up and made
the deep sea.</p>

<p>When the east and the west come together again, they
will fit like a garment that has been torn.</p></div>

<p>Then followed a rough outline of the western coasts
of Europe and Africa, and directly opposite the coasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of North and South America. The projections of the
one exactly fitted the indentations of the other, and
gave a semblance of truth and reality to the wild dream
of the Aztec philosopher. Let the geographer compare
them, and he will be more disposed to wonder than to
sneer.</p>

<p>I have not space enough left me to quote any further
from the monumental inscriptions, but if the reader be
curious upon this subject, I recommend to his attention
the publication soon to come out, alluded to above.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Some unusual event certainly had occurred in the city.
The great plaza in front of the palace was thronged with
a countless multitude of men and women, all clamoring
for a sacrifice! a sacrifice!</p>

<p>Whilst wondering what could be the cause of this
commotion, I was suddenly summoned before the Princess
in the audience-chamber, so often alluded to
before.</p>

<p>My surprise was great when, upon presenting myself
before her, I beheld, pinioned to a heavy log of mahogany,
a young man, evidently of European descent.</p>

<p>The Princess requested me to interpret for her to the
stranger, and the following colloquy took place. The
conversation was in the French language.</p>

<p>Q. "Who are you, and why do you invade my dominions?"</p>

<p>A. "My name is Armand de L'Oreille. I am a
Frenchman by birth. I was sent out by Lamartine, in
1848, as attach to the expedition of M. de Bourbourg,
whose duties were to explore the forests in the neighborhood
of Palenque, to collate the language of the
Central-American Indians, to copy the inscriptions on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the monuments, and, if possible, to reach the <span class="smcap">Living
City</span> mentioned by Waldeck, Dupaix, and the American
traveler Stephens."</p>

<p>Q. "But why are you alone? Where is the party to
which you belonged?"</p>

<p>A. "Most of them returned to Palenque, after wandering
in the wilderness a few days. Five only determined
to proceed; of that number I am the only survivor."</p>

<p>Here the interview closed.</p>

<p>The council and the queen were not long in determining
the fate of M. de L'Oreille. It was unanimously
resolved that he should surrender his life as a forfeit to
his temerity.</p>

<p>The next morning, at sunrise, was fixed for his death.
He was to be sacrificed upon the altar, on the summit
of the great Teocallis&mdash;an offering to <i>Quetzalcohuatl</i>, the
first great prince of the Aztecs. I at once determined
to save the life of the stranger, if I could do so, even at
the hazard of my own. But fate ordained it otherwise.
I retired earlier than usual, and lay silent and moody,
revolving on the best means to accomplish my end.</p>

<p>Midnight at length arrived; I crept stealthily from
my bed, and opened the door of my chamber, as lightly
as sleep creeps over the eyelids of children. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[Here the MS. is so blotted, and saturated with saltwater,
as to be illegible for several pages. The next
legible sentences are as follows.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>Here, for the first time, the woods looked familiar to
me. Proceeding a few steps, I fell into the trail leading
toward the modern village of Palenque, and, after
an hour's walk, I halted in front of the <i>cabilda</i> of the
town.</p>

<p>I was followed by a motley crowd to the office of the
Alcalde, who did not recognize me, dressed as I was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
skins, and half loaded down with rolls of MS., made
from the bark of the mulberry. I related to him and
M. de Bourbourg my adventures; and though the latter
declared he had lost poor Armand and his five companions,
yet I am persuaded that neither of them
credited a single word of my story.</p>

<p>Not many days after my safe arrival at Palenque, I
seized a favorable opportunity to visit the ruins of <i>Casa
Grande</i>. I readily found the opening to the subterranean
passage heretofore described, and after some troublesome
delays at the various landing-places, I finally
succeeded in reaching the very spot whence I had
ascended on that eventful night, nearly three years
before, in company with the Aztec Princess.</p>

<p>After exploring many of the mouldering and half-ruined
apartments of this immense palace, I accidentally
entered a small room, that at first seemed to have been
a place of sacrifice; but, upon closer inspection, I ascertained
that, like many of those in the "Living City,"
it was a chapel dedicated to the memory of some one of
the princes of the Aztec race.</p>

<p>In order to interpret the inscriptions with greater
facility, I lit six or seven candles, and placed them in
the best positions to illuminate the hieroglyphics.
Then turning, to take a view of the grand tablet in the
middle of the inscription, my astonishment was indescribable,
when I beheld the exact features, dress and
<i>panache</i> of the Aztec maiden, carved in the everlasting
marble before me.</p>

<h2>IX.</h2>

<h3><i>LEGENDS OF LAKE BIGLER.</i></h3>


<p class="secsc">I.&mdash;THE HAUNTED ROCK.</p>

<p class="cap">A great many years ago, ere the first white man
had trodden the soil of the American continent,
and before the palaces of Uxmal and Palenque were
masses of shapeless ruins&mdash;whilst the splendid structures,
now lining the banks of the Gila with broken
columns and fallen domes were inhabited by a nobler
race than the cowardly Pimos or the Ishmaelitish
Apaches, there lived and flourished on opposite shores
of Lake Bigler two rival nations, disputing with each
other for the supremacy of this inland sea, and making
perpetual war in order to accomplish the object of their
ambition.</p>

<p>The tribe dwelling upon the western shore was called
the Ako-ni-tas, whilst those inhabiting what is now the
State of Nevada were known by the name of Gra-so-po-itas.
Each nation was subdivided into smaller
principalities, over which subordinate sachems, or
chiefs, presided. In number, physical appearance,
and advance in the arts of civilization, both very much
resembled, and neither could be said to have decidedly
the pre-eminence.</p>

<p>At the time my story commences, Wan-ta-tay-to was
principal chief or king of the Ako-ni-tas, or, as they
were sometimes designated, O-kak-o-nitas, whilst Rhu-tog-au-di
presided over the destinies of the Gra-so-po-itas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
The language spoken by these tribes were
dialects of the same original tongue, and could be
easily understood the one by the other. Continued
intercourse, even when at war, had assimilated their
customs, laws and religion to such a degree that it
often became a matter of grave doubt as to which tribe
occasional deserters belonged. Intermarriage between
the tribes was strictly forbidden, and punished with
death in all cases, no matter what might be the rank,
power or wealth of the violators of the law.</p>

<p>At this era the surface of the lake was about sixty
feet higher than at the present time. Constant evaporation,
or perhaps the wearing channel of the Truckee,
has contributed to lower the level of the water, and
the same causes still continue in operation, as is clearly
perceptible by the watermarks of previous years.
Thousands of splendid canoes everywhere dotted its
surface; some of them engaged in the peaceful avocations
of fishing and hunting, whilst the large majority
were manned and armed for immediate and deadly
hostilities.</p>

<p>The year preceding that in which the events occurred
herein related, had been a very disastrous one to both
tribes. A great many deaths had ensued from casualties
in battle; but the chief source of disaster had
been a most terrific hurricane, which had swept over
the lake, upsetting, sinking, and destroying whole
fleets of canoes, with all persons aboard at the time.
Amongst the lost were both the royal barges, with the
sons and daughters of the chiefs. The loss had been
so overwhelming and general that the chief of the
O-kak-o-nitas had but one solitary representative of
the line royal left, and that was a beloved daughter
named Ta-kem-ena. The rival chieftain was equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
unfortunate, for his entire wigwam had perished with
the exception of Mo-ca-ru-po, his youngest son. But
these great misfortunes, instead of producing peace and
good-will, as a universal calamity would be sure to do
in an enlightened nation, tended only to embitter the
passions of the hostile kings and lend new terrors to
the war. At once made aware of what the other had
suffered, each promulgated a sort of proclamation,
offering an immense reward for the scalp of his rival's
heir.</p>

<p>Wan-ta-tay-to declared that he would give one half
his realm to whomsoever brought the body of Mo-ca-ru-po,
dead or alive, within his lines; and Rhu-tog-au-di,
not to be outdone in extravagance, registered an
oath that whosoever captured Ta-kem-ena, the beautiful
daughter of his enemy, should be rewarded with her
patrimonial rights, and also be associated with him in
ruling his own dominions.</p>

<p>As is universally the case with all American Indians,
the females are equally warlike and sometimes quite as
brave as the males. Ta-kem-ena was no exception to
this rule, and she accordingly made instant preparations
to capture or kill the heir to the throne of her
enemy. For this purpose she selected a small, light
bark canoe, and resolved all alone to make the attempt.
Nor did she communicate her intention to any one else.
Her father, even, was kept in profound ignorance of his
daughter's design.</p>

<p>About the same time, a desire for fame, and a thirsting
for supreme power, allured young Mo-ca-ru-po into
the lists of those who became candidates for the recent
reward offered by his father. He, too, determined to
proceed alone.</p>

<p>It was just at midnight, of a beautiful moonlight evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
that the young scions of royalty set forth from
opposite shores of the lake, and stealthily paddled for
the dominions of their enemies. When about half
across the boats came violently into collision. Each
warrior seized arms for the conflict. The light of the
full moon, riding at mid-heavens, fell softly upon the
features of the Princess, and at the same time illuminated
those of the young Prince.</p>

<p>The blows from the uplifted battle-axes failed to descend.
The poisoned arrows were returned to their
quivers. Surprise gave place quickly to admiration&mdash;that
to something more human&mdash;pity followed close in
the rear, and love, triumphant everywhere, paralyzed
the muscles, benumbed the faculties, and captured the
souls of his victims. Pouring a handful of the pure
water of the lake upon each other's heads, as a pledge
of love, and a ceremonial of marriage, in another moment
the two were locked in each other's arms, made
man and wife by the yearnings of the soul, and by a destiny
which naught but Omnipotent Power could avert.
What were the commands of kings, their threats, or
their punishments, in the scale with youth, and hope,
and love?</p>

<p>Never did those transparent waters leap more lightly
beneath the moonbeams than upon this auspicious night.
Hate, revenge, fame, power, all were forgotten in the
supreme delights of love.</p>

<p>Who, indeed, would not be a lover? The future
takes the hue of the rainbow, and spans the whole earth
with its arch. The past fades into instant oblivion, and
its dark scenes are remembered no more. Every beautiful
thing looks lovelier&mdash;spring's breath smells sweeter&mdash;the
heavens bend lower&mdash;the stars shine brighter. The
eyes, the lips, the smiles of the loved one, bankrupt all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
nature. The diamond's gleam, the flower's blush, the
fountain's purity, are all <i>her</i> own! The antelope's swiftness,
the buffalo's strength, the lion's bravery, are but
the reflex of <i>his</i> manly soul!</p>

<p>Fate thus had bound these two lovers in indissoluble
bonds: let us now see what it had left in reserve.</p>

<p>The plashing of paddles aroused the lovers from their
caressing. Quickly leaping into his own boat, side by
side, they flew over the exultant waves, careless for the
moment whither they went, and really aimless in their
destination. Having safely eluded their pursuers, if
such they were, the princes now consulted as to their
future course. After long and anxious debate it was
finally determined that they should part for the present,
and would each night continue to meet at midnight
at the majestic rock which towered up from the waves
high into the heavens, not far from what is now known
as Pray's Farm, that being the residence and headquarters
of the O-kak-oni-ta tribe.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after many protestations of eternal fidelity,
and warned by the ruddy gleam along the eastern
sky, they parted.</p>

<p>Night after night, for many weeks and months, the
faithful lovers met at the appointed place, and proved
their affection by their constancy. They soon made the
discovery that the immense rock was hollow, and contained
a magnificent cave. Here, safe from all observation,
the tardy months rolled by, both praying for peace,
yet neither daring to mention a termination of hostilities
to their sires. Finally, the usual concomitants of lawful
wedlock began to grow manifest in the rounded form of
the Princess&mdash;in her sadness, her drooping eyes, and
her perpetual uneasiness whilst in the presence of her
father. Not able any longer to conceal her griefs, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
became the court scandal, and she was summoned to
the royal presence and required to name her lover.
This, of course, she persisted in refusing, but spies
having been set upon her movements, herself and lover
were surrounded and entrapped in the fatal cave.</p>

<p>In vain did she plead for the life of the young prince,
regardless of her own. His doom was sealed. An
embassador was sent to Rhu-tog-au-di, announcing the
treachery of his son, and inviting that chief to be present
at the immolation of both victims. He willingly consented
to assist in the ceremonies. A grand council of
the two nations was immediately called, in order to
determine in what manner the death penalty should be
inflicted. After many and grave debates, it was resolved
that the lovers should be incarcerated in the
dark and gloomy cave where they had spent so many
happy hours, and there starve to death.</p>

<p>It was a grand gala-day with the O-kak-oni-tas and
the Gra-sop-o-itas. The mighty chiefs had been reconciled,
and the wealth, power and beauty of the two
realms turned out in all the splendor of fresh paint
and brilliant feathers, to do honor to the occasion. The
young princes were to be put to death. The lake in the
vicinity of the rock was alive with canoes. The hills in
the neighborhood were crowded with spectators. The
two old kings sat in the same splendid barge, and
followed close after the bark canoe in which the lovers
were being conveyed to their living tomb. Silently
they gazed into each other's faces and smiled. For
each other had they lived; with one another were they
now to die. Without food, without water, without
light, they were hurried into their bridal chamber, and
huge stones rolled against the only entrance.</p>

<p>Evening after evening the chiefs sat upon the grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
portals of their children. At first they were greeted with
loud cries, extorted by the gnawing of hunger and the
agony of thirst. Gradually the cries gave way to low
moans, and finally, after ten days had elapsed, the tomb
became as silent as the lips of the lovers. Then the
huge stones were, by the command of the two kings,
rolled away, and a select body of warriors ordered to
enter and bring forth their lifeless forms. But the west
wind had sprung up, and just as the stones were taken
from the entrance, a low, deep, sorrowful sigh issued
from the mouth of the cave. Startled and terrified
beyond control, the warriors retreated hastily from the
spot; and the weird utterances continuing, no warriors
could be found brave enough to sound the depths of
that dreadful sepulchre. Day after day canoes crowded
about the mouth of the cave, and still the west wind
blew, and still the sighs and moans continued to strike
the souls of the trembling warriors.</p>

<p>Finally, no canoe dared approach the spot. In paddling
past they would always veer their canoes seaward,
and hurry past with all the speed they could command.</p>

<p>Centuries passed away; the level of the lake had
sunk many feet; the last scions of the O-kak-oni-tas and
the Gra-sop-o-itas had mouldered many years in the
burying-grounds of their sires, and a new race had
usurped their old hunting grounds. Still no one had
ever entered the haunted cave.</p>

<p>One day, late in the autumn of 1849, a company of
emigrants on their way to California, were passing,
toward evening, the month of the cavern, and hearing
a strange, low, mournful sigh, seeming to issue thence,
they landed their canoe and resolved to solve the mystery.
Lighting some pitch-pine torches, they proceeded
cautiously to explore the cavern. For a long time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
could discern nothing. At length, in the furthest corner
of the gloomy recess, they found two human skeletons,
with their bony arms entwined, and their fleshless
skulls resting upon each other's bosoms. The lovers
are dead, but the old cave still echoes with their dying
sobs.</p>

<p class="secsc">II.&mdash;DICK BARTER'S YARN; OR, THE LAST OF THE MERMAIDS.</p>

<p>Well, Dick began, you see I am an old salt, having
sailed the seas for more than forty-nine years, and
being entirely unaccustomed to living upon the land.
By some accident or other, I found myself, in the
winter of 1849, cook for a party of miners who were
sluicing high up the North Fork of the American. We
had a hard time all winter, and when spring opened, it
was agreed that I and a comrade named Liehard should
cross the summit and spend a week fishing at the lake.
We took along an old Washoe Indian, who spoke Spanish,
as a guide. This old man had formerly lived on
the north margin of the lake, near where Tahoe City is
now situated, and was perfectly familiar with all the
most noted fishing grounds and chief points of interest
throughout its entire circuit.</p>

<p>We had hardly got started before he commenced
telling us of a remarkable struggle, which he declared
had been going on for many hundred years between a
border tribe of Indians and the inhabitants of the lake,
whom he designated as Water-men, or "<i>hombres de las
aguas</i>." On asking if he really meant to say that human
beings lived and breathed like fish in Lake Bigler, he
declared without any hesitation that such was the fact;
that he had often seen them; and went on to describe
a terrific combat he witnessed a great many years ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
between a Pol-i-wog chief and <i>a man of the water</i>. On
my expressing some doubt as to the veracity of the
statement, he proffered to show us the very spot where
it occurred; and at the same time expressed a belief
that by manufacturing a whistle from the bark of the
mountain chinquapin, and blowing it as the Pol-i-wogs
did, we might entice some of their old enemies from
the depths of the lake. My curiosity now being raised
tip-toe, I proceeded to interrogate Juan more closely,
and in answer I succeeded in obtaining the following
curious particulars:</p>

<p>The tribe of border Indians called the Pol-i-wogs
were a sort of amphibious race, and a hybrid between
the Pi-Utes and the mermaids of the lake. They were
of a much lighter color than their progenitors, and were
distinguished by a great many peculiar characteristics.
Exceedingly few in number, and quarrelsome in the
extreme, they resented every intrusion upon the waters
of the lake as a personal affront, and made perpetual
war upon neighboring tribes. Hence, as Juan remarked,
they soon became extinct after the invasion of the
Washoes. The last of them disappeared about twenty-five
years ago. The most noted of their peculiarities
were the following:</p>

<p>First. Their heads were broad and extremely flat;
the eyes protuberant, and the ears scarcely perceptible&mdash;being
a small opening closed by a movable valve
shaped like the scale of a salmon. Their mouths were
very large, extending entirely across the cheeks, and
bounded by a hard rim of bone, instead of the common
lip. In appearance, therefore, the head did not look
unlike an immense catfish head, except there were no
fins about the jaws, and no feelers, as we call them.</p>

<p>Second. Their necks were short, stout, and chubby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and they possessed the power of inflating them at will,
and thus distending them to two or three times their
ordinary size.</p>

<p>Third. Their bodies were long, round, and flexible.
When wet, they glistened in the sun like the back of an
eel, and seemed to possess much greater buoyancy than
those of common men. But the greatest wonder of all
was a kind of loose membrane, that extended from beneath
their shoulders all the way down their sides, and
connected itself with the upper portion of their thighs.
This loose skin resembled the wings of the common house
bat, and when spread out, as it always did in the water,
looked like the membrane lining of the legs and fore
feet of the chipmunk.</p>

<p>Fourth. The hands and feet were distinguished for
much greater length of toe and finger; and their extremities
grew together like the toes of a duck, forming a
complete web betwixt all the fingers and toes.</p>

<p>The Pol-i-wogs lived chiefly upon fish and oysters, of
which there was once a great abundance in the lake.
They were likewise cannibals, and ate their enemies
without stint or compunction. A young Washoe girl
was considered a feast, but a lake maiden was the <i>ne
plus ultra</i> of luxuries. The Washoes reciprocated the
compliment, and fattened upon the blubber of the Pol-i-wogs.
It is true that they were extremely difficult to
capture, for, when hotly pursued, they plunged into the
lake, and by expert swimming and extraordinary diving,
they generally managed to effect their escape.</p>

<p>Juan having exhausted his budget concerning the
Pol-i-wogs, I requested him to give us as minute a description
of the Lake Mermaids. This he declined for
the present to do, alleging as an excuse that we would
first attempt to capture, or at least to see one for ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and if our hunt was unsuccessful, he would then
gratify our curiosity.</p>

<p>It was some days before we came in sight of this
magnificent sheet of water. Finally, however, after
many perilous adventures in descending the Sierras, we
reached the margin of the lake. Our first care was to
procure trout enough to last until we got ready to return.
That was an easy matter, for in those days the lake was
far more plentifully supplied than at present. We caught
many thousands at a place where a small brook came
down from the mountains, and formed a pool not a great
distance from its entrance into the lake, and this pool
was alive with them. It occupied us but three days to
catch, clean, and sun-dry as many as our single mule
could carry, and having still nearly a week to spare we
determined to start off in pursuit of the mermaids.</p>

<p>Our guide faithfully conducted us to the spot where
he beheld the conflict between the last of the Pol-i-wogs
and one of the water-men. As stated above, it is
nearly on the spot where Tahoe City now stands. The
battle was a fierce one, as the combatants were equally
matched in strength and endurance, and was finally
terminated only by the interposition of a small party of
Washoes, our own guide being of the number. The
struggle was chiefly in the water, the Pol-i-wog being
better able to swim than the mermaid was to walk. Still,
as occasion required, a round or two took place on the
gravelly beach. Never did old Spain and England
engage in fiercer conflict for the dominion of the seas,
than now occurred between Pol-i-wog and Merman for
the mastery of the lake. Each fought, as the Roman
fought, for Empire. The Pol-i-wog, like the last of
the Mohicans, had seen his tribe melt away, until he
stood, like some solitary column at Persepolis, the sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
monument of a once gorgeous temple. The water chieftain
also felt that upon his arm, or rather tail, everything
that made life desirable was staked. Above all,
the trident of his native sea was involved.</p>

<p>The weapons of the Pol-i-wog were his teeth and his
hind legs. Those of the Merman were all concentrated
in the flop of his scaly tail. With the energy of a dying
alligator, he would encircle, with one tremendous effort,
the bruised body of the Pol-i-wog, and floor him beautifully
on the beach. Recovering almost instantly, the
Pol-i-wog would seize the Merman by the long black
hair, kick him in the region of the stomach, and grapple
his windpipe between his bony jaws, as the mastiff
does the infuriated bull.</p>

<p>Finally, after a great many unsuccessful attempts to
drag the Pol-i-wog into deep water, the mermaid was
seized by her long locks and suddenly jerked out upon
the beach in a very battered condition. At this moment,
the Washoes with a yell rushed toward the combatants,
but the Pol-i-wog seeing death before him upon water
and land equally, preferred the embraces of the water
nymphs to the stomachs of the landsmen, and rolling
over rapidly was soon borne off into unfathomable depths
by the triumphant Merman.</p>

<p>Such was the story of Juan. It resembled the condition
of the ancient Britons, who, being crowded by the
Romans from the sea, and attacked by the Picts from
the interior, lamented their fate as the most unfortunate
of men. "The Romans," they said, "drive us into the
land; there we are met by the Picts, who in turn drive
us into the sea. We must perish in either event. Those
whom enemies spare, the waves devour."</p>

<p>Our first step was to prepare a chinquapin whistle.
The flute was easily manufactured by Juan himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
thuswise: He cut a twig about eighteen inches in length,
and not more than half an inch in diameter, and peeling
the bark from the ends an inch or so, proceeded to rub
the bark rapidly with a dry stick peeled perfectly
smooth. In a short time the sap in the twig commenced
to exude from both ends. Then placing the
large end between his teeth he pulled suddenly, and the
bark slipped off with a crack in it. Then cutting a small
hole in the form of a parallelogram, near the upper end,
he adjusted a stopper with flattened surface so as to fit
exactly the opening. Cutting off the end of the stopple
even with the bark and filling the lower opening nearly
full of clay, he declared the work was done. As a proof
of this, he blew into the hollow tube, and a low, musical
sound was emitted, very flute-like and silvery. When
blown harshly, it could be heard at a great distance, and
filled the air with melodious echoes.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, we set out upon our search. The
first two days were spent unsuccessfully. On the third
we found ourselves near what is now called Agate Beach.
At this place a small cove indents the land, which sweeps
round in the form of a semi-circle. The shore is literally
packed with agates and crystals. We dug some
more than two feet deep in several places, but still
could find no bottom to the glittering floor. They are
of all colors, but the prevailing hues are red and yellow.
Here Juan paused, and lifting his whistle to his lips, he
performed a multitude of soft, gentle airs, which floated
across the calm waves like a lover's serenade breathes
o'er the breast of sleeping beauty. It all seemed in
vain. We had now entirely circumnavigated the lake,
and were on the eve of despairing utterly, when suddenly
we beheld the surface of the lake, nearly a quarter
of a mile from the shore, disturbed violently, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
some giant whale were floundering with a harpoon in its
side. In a moment more the head and neck of one of
those tremendous serpents that of late years have infested
the lake, were uplifted some ten or fifteen feet
above the surface. Almost at the same instant we beheld
the head, face and hair, as of a human being,
emerge quickly from the water, and look back toward
the pursuing foe. The truth flashed upon us instantaneously.
Here was a mermaid pursued by a serpent.
On they came, seemingly regardless of our presence,
and had approached to within twenty yards of the spot
where we stood, when suddenly both came to a dead
halt. Juan had never ceased for a moment to blow his
tuneful flute, and it now became apparent that the notes
had struck their hearing at the same time. To say that
they were charmed would but half express their ecstatic
condition. They were absolutely entranced.</p>

<p>The huge old serpent lolled along the waters for a
hundred feet or so, and never so much as shook the
spray from his hide. He looked like Milton's portrait
of Satan, stretched out upon the burning marl of hell.
In perfect contrast with the sea monster, the beautiful
mermaiden lifted her pallid face above the water, dripping
with the crystal tears of the lake, and gathering
her long raven locks, that floated like the train of a
meteor down her back, she carelessly flung them across
her swelling bosom, as if to reproach us for gazing upon
her beauteous form. But there my eyes were fastened!
If she were entranced by the music, I was not less so
with her beauty. Presently the roseate hues of a dying
dolphin played athwart her brow and cheeks, and ere
long a gentle sigh, as if stolen from the trembling
chords of an Eolian harp, issued from her coral lips.
Again and again it broke forth, until it beat in full
symphony with the cadences of Juan's rustic flute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>My attention was at this moment aroused by the suspicious
clicking of my comrade's rifle. Turning around
suddenly, I beheld Liehard, with his piece leveled at
the unconscious mermaid.</p>

<p>"Great God!" I exclaimed! "Liehard, would you
commit murder?" But the warning came too late, for
instantaneously the quick report of his rifle and the terrific
shriek of the mermaid broke the noontide stillness;
and, rearing her bleeding form almost entirely out of
the water, she plunged headlong forwards, a corpse.
Beholding his prey, powerless within his grasp, the
serpent splashed toward her, and, ere I could cock my
rifle, he had seized her unresisting body, and sank with
it into the mysterious caverns of the lake. At this instant,
I gave a loud outcry, as if in pain. On opening
my eyes, my wife was bending over me, the midday
sun was shining in my face, Dick Barter was spinning
some confounded yarn about the Bay of Biscay and the
rum trade of Jamaica, and the sloop <i>Edith Beaty</i> was
still riding at anchor off the wild glen, and gazing tranquilly
at her ugly image in the crystal mirror of Lake
Bigler.</p>

<h2>XI.</h2>

<h3><i>THE TELESCOPIC EYE.</i></h3>

<p class="secsc">A LEAF FROM A REPORTER'S NOTE-BOOK.</p>


<p class="cap">For the past five or six weeks, rumors of a strange
abnormal development of the powers of vision of
a youth named Johnny Palmer, whose parents reside at
South San Francisco, have been whispered around in
scientific circles in the city, and one or two short notices
have appeared in the columns of some of our contemporaries
relative to the prodigious <i>lusus natur</i>, as the
scientists call it.</p>

<p>Owing to the action taken by the California College
of Sciences, whose members comprise some of our most
scientific citizens, the affair has assumed such importance
as to call for a careful and exhaustive investigation.</p>

<p>Being detailed to investigate the flying stories, with
regard to the powers of vision claimed for a lad named
John or "Johnny" Palmer, as his parents call him, we
first of all ventured to send in our card to Professor
Gibbins, the President of the California College of
Sciences. It is always best to call at the fountain-head
for useful information, a habit which our two hundred
thousand readers on this coast can never fail to see and
appreciate. An estimable gentleman of the African
persuasion, to whom we handed our "pasteboard," soon
returned with the polite message, "Yes, sir; <i>in</i>. Please
walk up." And so we followed our conductor through
several passages almost as dark as the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
<i>cicerone</i>, and in a few moments found ourselves in the
presence of, perhaps, the busiest man in the city of San
Francisco.</p>

<p>Without any flourish of trumpets, the Professor inquired
our object in seeking him and the information we
desired. "Ah," said he, "that is a long story. I have
no time to go into particulars just now. I am computing
the final sheet of Professor Davidson's report of the
Transit of Venus, last year, at Yokohama and Loo-Choo.
It must be ready before May, and it requires six months'
work to do it correctly."</p>

<p>"But," I rejoined, "can't you tell me where the lad
is to be found?"</p>

<p>"And if I did, they will not let you see him."</p>

<p>"Let me alone for that," said I, smiling; "a reporter,
like love, finds his way where wolves would fear to
tread."</p>

<p>"Really, my dear sir," quickly responded the Doctor,
"I have no time to chat this morning. Our special
committee submitted its report yesterday, which is on
file in that book-case; and if you will promise not to
publish it until after it has been read in open session
of the College, you may take it to your sanctum, run
it over, and clip from it enough to satisfy the public
for the present."</p>

<p>Saying this, he rose from his seat, opened the case,
took from a pigeon-hole a voluminous written document
tied up with red tape, and handed it to me, adding, "Be
careful!" Seating himself without another word, he
turned his back on me, and I sallied forth into the
street.</p>

<p>Reaching the office, I scrutinized the writing on the
envelope, and found it as follows: "Report of Special
Committee&mdash;Boy Palmer&mdash;Vision&mdash;Laws of Light&mdash;Filed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
February 10, 1876&mdash;Stittmore, Sec." Opening the
document, I saw at once that it was a full, accurate, and,
up to the present time, complete account of the phenomenal
case I was after, and regretted the promise
made not to publish the entire report until read in open
session of the College. Therefore, I shall be compelled
to give the substance of the report in my own words,
only giving <i>verbatim</i> now and then a few scientific
phrases which are not fully intelligible to me, or susceptible
of circumlocution in common language.</p>

<p>The report is signed by Doctors Bryant, Gadbury and
Golson, three of our ablest medical men, and approved
by Professor Smyth, the oculist. So far, therefore, as
authenticity and scientific accuracy are concerned, our
readers may rely implicitly upon the absolute correctness
of every fact stated and conclusion reached.</p>

<p>The first paragraph of the report gives the name of
the child, "John Palmer, age, nine years, and place of
residence, South San Francisco, Culp Hill, near Catholic
Orphan Asylum;" and then plunges at once into <i>in
medias res</i>.</p>

<p>It appears that the period through which the investigation
ran was only fifteen days; but it seems to have
been so thorough, by the use of the ophthalmoscope and
other modern appliances and tests, that no regrets
ought to be indulged as to the brevity of the time employed
in experiments. Besides, we have superadded
a short and minute account of our own, verifying some
of the most curious facts reported, with several tests
proposed by ourselves and not included in the statement
of the scientific committee.</p>

<p>To begin, then, with the beginning of the inquiries by
the committee. They were conducted into a small back
room, darkened by old blankets hung up at the window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
for the purpose of the total exclusion of daylight;
an absurd remedy for blindness, recommended by a
noted quack whose name adorns the extra fly-leaf of the
San Francisco <i>Truth Teller</i>. The lad was reclining upon
an old settee, ill-clad and almost idiotic in expression.
As the committee soon ascertained, his mother only was
at home, the father being absent at his customary occupation&mdash;that
of switch-tender on the San Jose Railroad.
She notified her son of the presence of strangers
and he rose and walked with a firm step toward where
the gentlemen stood, at the entrance of the room. He
shook them all by the hand and bade them good morning.
In reply to questions rapidly put and answered
by his mother, the following account of the infancy of
the boy and the accidental discovery of his extraordinary
powers of vision was given:</p>

<p>He was born in the house where the committee found
him, nine years ago the 15th of last January. Nothing
of an unusual character occurred until his second year,
when it was announced by a neighbor that the boy was
completely blind, his parents never having been suspicious
of the fact before that time, although the mother
declared that for some months anterior to the discovery
she had noticed some acts of the child that seemed to
indicate mental imbecility rather than blindness. From
this time forward until a few months ago nothing happened
to vary the boy's existence except a new remedy
now and then prescribed by neighbors for the supposed
malady. He was mostly confined to a darkened chamber,
and was never trusted alone out of doors. He
grew familiar, by touch and sound, with the forms of
most objects about him, and could form very accurate
guesses of the color and texture of them all. His conversational
powers did not seem greatly impaired, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
he readily acquired much useful knowledge from listening
attentively to everything that was said in his presence.
He was quite a musician, and touched the harmonicon,
banjo and accordeon with skill and feeling.
He was unusually sensitive to the presence of light,
though incapable of seeing any object with any degree
of distinctness; and hence the attempt to exclude light
as the greatest enemy to the recovery of vision. It was
very strange that up to the time of the examination of
the committee, no scientific examination of the boy's
eye had been made by a competent oculist, the parents
contenting themselves with the chance opinions of visitors
or the cheap nostrums of quacks. It is perhaps
fortunate for science that this was the case, as a cure
for the eye might have been an extinction of its abnormal
power.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 12th of December last (1875),
the position of the child's bed was temporarily changed
to make room for a visitor. The bed was placed against
the wall of the room, fronting directly east, with the
window opening at the side of the bed next to the head.
The boy was sent to bed about seven o'clock, and the
parents and their visitor were seated in the front room,
spending the evening in social intercourse. The moon
rose full and cloudless about half-past seven o'clock,
and shone full in the face of the sleeping boy.</p>

<p>Something aroused him from slumber, and when he
opened his eyes the first object they encountered was
the round disk of her orb. By some oversight the curtain
had been removed from the window, and probably
for the first time in his life he beheld the lustrous queen
of night swimming in resplendent radiance, and bathing
hill and bay in effulgent glory. Uttering a cry,
equally of terror and delight, he sprang up in bed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
sat there like a statue, with eyes aglare, mouth open,
finger pointed, and astonishment depicted on every
feature. His sudden, sharp scream brought his mother
to his side, who tried for some moments in vain to distract
his gaze from the object before him. Failing even
to attract notice, she called in her husband and friend,
and together they besought the boy to lie down and go
to sleep, but to no avail. Believing him to be ill and in
convulsions, they soon seized him, and were on the
point of immersing him in a hot bath, when, with a
sudden spring, he escaped from their grasp and ran out
the front door. Again he fixed his unwinking eyes upon
the moon, and remained speechless for several seconds.
At length, having seemingly satisfied his present curiosity,
he turned on his mother, who stood wringing her
hands in the doorway and moaning piteously, and exclaimed,
"I can see the moon yonder, and it is so beautiful
that I am going there to-morrow morning, as soon
as I get up."</p>

<p>"How big does it look?" said his mother.</p>

<p>"So big," he replied, "that I cannot see it all at one
glance&mdash;as big as all out of doors."</p>

<p>"How far off from you does it seem to be?"</p>

<p>"About half a car's distance," he quickly rejoined.</p>

<p>It may be here remarked that the boy's idea of distance
had been measured all his life by the distance
from his home to the street-car station at the foot of the
hill. This was about two hundred yards, so that the
reply indicated that the moon appeared to be only one
hundred yards from the spectator. The boy then proceeded
of his own accord to give a very minute description
of the appearance of objects which he beheld, corresponding,
of course, to his poverty of words with
which to clothe his ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>His account of things beheld by him was so curious,
wonderful and apparently accurate, that the little group
about him passed rapidly from a conviction of his insanity
to a belief no less absurd&mdash;that he had become,
in the cant lingo of the day, a seeing, or "clairvoyant"
medium. Such was the final conclusion to which his
parents had arrived at the time of the visit of the scientific
committee. He had been classed with that credulous
school known to this century as spiritualists, and
had been visited solely by persons of that ilk heretofore.</p>

<p>The committee having fully examined the boy, and a
number of independent witnesses, as to the facts, soon
set about a scientific investigation of the true causes of
of the phenomenon. The first step, of course, was to
examine the lad's eye with the modern ophthalmoscope,
an invention of Professor Helmholtz, of Heidelberg, a
few years ago, by means of which the depths of this
organ can be explored, and the smallest variations from
a healthy or normal condition instantaneously detected.</p>

<p>The mode of using the instrument is as follows: The
room is made perfectly dark; a brilliant light is then
placed near the head of the patient, and the rays are
reflected by a series of small mirrors into his eye, as if
they came from the eye of the observer; then, by looking
through the central aperture of the instrument, the
oculist can examine the illuminated interior of the eyeball,
and perceive every detail of structure, healthy or
morbid, as accurately and clearly as we can see any part
of the exterior of the body. No discomfort arises to
the organ examined, and all its hidden mysteries can be
studied and understood as clearly as those of any other
organ of the body.</p>

<p>This course was taken with John Palmer, and the
true secret of his mysterious power of vision detected
in an instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>On applying the ophthalmoscope, the committee ascertained
in a moment that the boy's eye was abnormally
shaped. A natural, perfect eye is perfectly round. But
the eye examined was exceedingly flat, very thin, with
large iris, flat lens, immense petira, and wonderfully
dilated pupil. The effect of the shape was at once
apparent. It was utterly impossible to see any object
with distinctness at any distance short of many thousands
of miles. Had the eye been elongated inward, or
shaped like an egg&mdash;to as great an extent, the boy
would have been effectually blind, for no combination
of lens power could have placed the image of the object
beyond the coat of the retina. In other words, there
are two common imperfections of the human organ of
sight; one called <i>myopia</i>, or "near-sightedness;" the
<i>presbyopia</i>, or "far-sightedness."</p>

<p>"The axis being too long," says the report, "in
myopic eyes, parallel rays, such as proceed from distant
objects, are brought to a focus at a point so far in front
of the retina, that only confused images are formed
upon it. Such a malformation, constituting an excess of
refractive power, can only be neutralized by concave
glasses, which give such a direction to rays entering
the eye as will allow of their being brought to a focus
at a proper point for distant perception."</p>

<p>"Presbyopia is the reverse of all this. The antero-posterior
axis of such eyes being too short, owing to
the flat plate-like shape of the ball, their refractive
power is not sufficient to bring even parallel rays to a
focus upon the retina, but is adapted for convergent
rays only. Convex glasses, in a great measure, compensate
for this quality by rendering parallel rays convergent;
and such glasses, in ordinary cases, bring the
rays to a focus at a convenient distance from the glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
corresponding to its degree of curvature." But in the case
under examination, no glass or combination of glasses
could be invented sufficiently concave to remedy the
malformation. By a mathematical problem of easy solution,
it was computed that the nearest distance from the
unaided eye of the patient at which a distinct image
could be formed upon the retina, was two hundred and
forty thousand miles, a fraction short of the mean distance
of the moon from the earth; and hence it became
perfectly clear that the boy could see with minute
distinctness whatever was transpiring on the surface of
the moon.</p>

<p>Such being the undeniable truth as demonstrated by
science, the declaration of the lad assumed a far higher
value than the mere dicta of spiritualists, or the mad
ravings of a monomaniac; and the committee at once
set to work to glean all the astronomical knowledge
they could by frequent and prolonged night interviews
with the boy.</p>

<p>It was on the night of January 9, 1876, that the first
satisfactory experiment was tried, testing beyond all
cavil or doubt the powers of the subject's eye. It was
full moon, and that luminary rose clear and dazzlingly
bright. The committee were on hand at an early hour,
and the boy was in fine condition and exuberant spirits.
The interview was secret, and none but the members
of the committee and the parents of the child were
present. Of course the first proposition to be settled
was that of the inhabitability of that sphere. This the
boy had frequently declared was the case, and he had
on several previous occasions described minutely the
form, size and means of locomotion of the Lunarians.
On this occasion he repeated in almost the same language,
what he had before related to his parents and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
friends, but was more minute, owing to the greater
transparency of the atmosphere and the experience in
expression already acquired.</p>

<p>The Lunarians are not formed at all like ourselves.
They are less in height, and altogether of a different
appearance. When fully grown, they resemble somewhat
a chariot wheel, with four spokes, converging at
the center or axle. They have four eyes in the head,
which is the axle, so to speak, and all the limbs branch
out directly from the center, like some sea-forms known
as "Radiates." They move by turning rapidly like a
wheel, and travel as fast as a bird through the air.
The children are undeveloped in form, and are perfectly
round, like a pumpkin or orange. As they grow older,
they seem to drop or absorb the rotundity of the whole
body, and finally assume the appearance of a chariot
wheel.</p>

<p>They are of different colors, or nationalities&mdash;bright
red, orange and blue being the predominant hues. The
reds are in a large majority. They do no work, but
sleep every four or five hours. They have no houses,
and need none. They have no clothing, and do not
require it. There being no night on the side of the
moon fronting the sun, and no day on the opposite side,
all the inhabitants, apparently at a given signal of some
kind, form into vast armies, and flock in myriads to the
sleeping grounds on the shadow-side of the planet.
They do not appear to go very far over the dark rim,
for they reappear in immense platoons in a few hours,
and soon spread themselves over the illuminated surface.
They sleep and wake about six times in one
ordinary day of twenty-four hours. Their occupations
cannot be discerned; they must be totally different from
anything upon the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>The surface of the moon is all hill and hollow. There
are but few level spots, nor is there any water visible.
The atmosphere is almost as refined and light as hydrogen
gas. There is no fire visible, nor are there any volcanoes.
Most of the time of the inhabitants seems to be
spent in playing games of locomotion, spreading themselves
into squares, circles, triangles, and other mathematical
figures. They move always in vast crowds. No
one or two are ever seen separated from the main bodies.
The children also flock in herds, and seem to be all of
one family. Individualism is unknown. They seem to
spawn like herring or shad, or to be propagated like
bees, from the queen, in myriads. Motion is their
normal condition. The moment after a mathematical
figure is formed, it is dissolved, and fresh combinations
take place, like the atoms in a kaleidoscope. No other
species of animal, bird, or being exist upon the illuminated
face of the moon.</p>

<p>The shrubbery and vegetation of the moon is all
metallic. Vegetable life nowhere exists; but the forms
of some of the shrubs and trees are exceedingly beautiful.
The highest trees do not exceed twenty-five feet,
and they appear to have all acquired their full growth.
The ground is strewn with flowers, but they are all
formed of metals&mdash;gold, silver, copper, and tin predominating.
But there is a new kind of metal seen everywhere
on tree, shrub and flower, nowhere known on the
earth. It is of a bright vermilion color, and is semi-transparent.
The mountains are all of bare and burnt
granite, and appear to have been melted with fire. The
committee called the attention of the boy to the bright
"sea of glass" lately observed near the northern rim of
the moon, and inquired of what it is composed. He
examined it carefully, and gave such a minute description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of it that it became apparent at once to the committee
that it was pure mercury or quicksilver. The
reason why it has but very recently shown itself to
astronomers is thus accounted for: it appears close up
to the line of demarcation separating the light and
shadow upon the moon's disk; and on closer inspection
a distinct cataract of the fluid&mdash;in short, a metallic
Niagara, was clearly seen falling from the night side to
the day side of the luminary. It has already filled up
a vast plain&mdash;one of the four that exist on the moon's
surface&mdash;and appears to be still emptying itself with
very great rapidity and volume. It covers an area of
five by seven hundred miles in extent, and may possibly
deluge one half the entire surface of the moon. It does
not seem to occasion much apprehension to the inhabitants,
as they were soon skating, so to speak, in platoons
and battalions, over and across it. In fact, it presents
the appearance of an immense park, to which the Lunarians
flock, and disport themselves with great gusto
upon its polished face. One of the most beautiful
sights yet seen by the lad was the formation of a new
figure, which he drew upon the sand with his finger.</p>

<p>The central heart was of crimson-colored natives;
the one to the right of pale orange, and the left of
bright blue. It was ten seconds in forming, and five
seconds in dispersing. The number engaged in the
evolution could not be less than half a million.</p>

<p>Thus has been solved one of the great astronomical
questions of the century.</p>

<p>The next evening the committee assembled earlier,
so as to get a view of the planet Venus before the moon
rose. It was the first time that the lad's attention had
been drawn to any of the planets, and he evinced the
liveliest joy when he first beheld the cloudless disk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
that resplendent world. It may here be stated that his
power of vision, in looking at the fixed stars, was no
greater or less than that of an ordinary eye. They
appeared only as points of light, too far removed into
the infinite beyond to afford any information concerning
their properties. But the committee were doomed
to a greater disappointment when they inquired of the
boy what he beheld on the surface of Venus. He replied,
"Nothing clearly; all is confused and watery; I
see nothing with distinctness." The solution of the
difficulty was easily apprehended, and at once surmised.
The focus of the eye was fixed by nature at 240,000
miles, and the least distance of Venus from the earth
being 24,293,000 miles, it was, of course, impossible to
observe that planet's surface with distinctness. Still
she appeared greatly enlarged, covering about one
hundredth part of the heavens, and blazing with unimaginable
splendor.</p>

<p>Experiments upon Jupiter and Mars were equally
futile, and the committee half sorrowfully turned again
to the inspection of the moon.</p>

<p>The report then proceeds at great length to give full
descriptions of the most noted geographical peculiarities
of the lunar surface, and corrects many errors fallen
into by Herschel, Leverrier and Proctor. Professor
Secchi informs us that the surface of the moon is much
better known to astronomers than the surface of the
earth is to geographers; for there are two zones on the
globe within the Arctic and Antarctic circles, that we
can never examine. But every nook and cranny of the
illuminated face of the moon has been fully delineated,
examined and named, so that no object greater than
sixty feet square exists but has been seen and photographed
by means of Lord Rosse's telescope and De la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Ruis' camera and apparatus. As the entire report will
be ordered published at the next weekly meeting of the
College, we refrain from further extracts, but now proceed
to narrate the results of our own interviews with
the boy.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the 17th of February, 1876,
that we ventured with rather a misgiving heart to approach
Culp Hill, and the humble residence of a child
destined, before the year is out, to become the most
celebrated of living beings. We armed ourselves with
a pound of sugar candy for the boy, some <i>muslin-de-laine</i>
as a present to the mother, and a box of cigars for
the father. We also took with us a very large-sized
opera-glass, furnished for the purpose by M. Muller.
At first we encountered a positive refusal; then, on exhibiting
the cigars, a qualified negative; and finally,
when the muslin and candy were drawn on the enemy,
we were somewhat coldly invited in and proffered a
seat. The boy was pale and restless, and his eyes
without bandage or glasses. We soon ingratiated ourself
into the good opinion of the whole party, and
henceforth encountered no difficulty in pursuing our
investigations. The moon being nearly full, we first of
all verified the tests by the committee. These were all
perfectly satisfactory and reliable. Requesting, then,
to stay until after midnight, for the purpose of inspecting
Mars with the opera-glass, we spent the interval in
obtaining the history of the child, which we have given
above.</p>

<p>The planet Mars being at this time almost in dead
opposition to the sun, and with the earth in conjunction,
is of course as near to the earth as he ever approaches,
the distance being thirty-five millions of
miles. He rises toward midnight, and is in the constellation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Virgo, where he may be seen to the greatest
possible advantage, being in perigee. Mars is most
like the earth of all the planetary bodies. He revolves
on his axis in a little over twenty-four hours, and his
surface is pleasantly variegated with land and water,
pretty much like our own world&mdash;the land, however,
being in slight excess. He is, therefore, the most interesting
of all the heavenly bodies to the inhabitants
of the earth.</p>

<p>Having all things in readiness, we directed the glass
to the planet. Alas, for all our calculations, the power
was insufficient to clear away the obscurity resulting
from imperfect vision and short focus.</p>

<p>Swallowing the bitter disappointment, we hastily
made arrangements for another interview, with a telescope,
and bade the family good night.</p>

<p>There is but one large telescope properly mounted in
the city, and that is the property and pride of its accomplished
owner, J. P. Manrow, Esq. We at once procured
an interview with that gentleman, and it was
agreed that on Saturday evening the boy should be
conveyed to his residence, picturesquely situated on
Russian Hill, commanding a magnificent view of the
Golden Gate and the ocean beyond.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the boy, his parents and myself
presented ourselves at the door of that hospitable
mansion. We were cordially welcomed, and conducted
without further parley into the lofty observatory on the
top of the house. In due time the magnificent tube
was presented at the planet, but it was discovered that
the power it was set for was too low. It was then
gauged for 240,000 diameters, being the full strength
of the telescope, and the eye of the boy observer placed
at the eye-glass. One cry of joy, and unalloyed delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
told the story! Mars, and its mountains and seas, its
rivers, vales, and estuaries, its polar snow-caps and
grassy plains&mdash;its inhabitants, palaces, ships, villages
and cities, were all revealed, as distinctly, clearly and
certainly, as the eye of Kit Carson, from the summits
of the Sierra Nevada range, beheld the stupendous
panorama of the Sacramento Valley, and the snow-clad
summits of Mount Hood and Shasta Butte.</p>

<p class="secsc">GEN. FLANNAGAN'S REPORT.</p>

<p class="sig">B<span class="smsmcap">ruges</span>, December 12, 1872.</p>

<p>To <span class="smsmcap">the</span> H<span class="smsmcap">on.</span> H<span class="smsmcap">amilton</span> F<span class="smsmcap">ish</span>,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 8em;">Secretary of State.</span></p>

<p>S<span class="smsmcap">ir</span>: In pursuance of special instructions recently received
from Washington (containing inclosures from Prof. Henry
of the Smithsonian Institute, and Prof. Lovering of Harvard),
I proceeded on Wednesday last to the scene of
operations at the "International Exploring Works," and
beg leave to submit the following circumstantial report:</p>

<p>Before proceeding to detail the actual state of affairs at
Dudzeele, near the line of canal connecting Bruges with
the North Sea, it may not be out of place to furnish a
succinct history of the origin of the explorations out of
which the present alarming events have arisen. It will be
remembered by the State Department that during the short
interregnum of the provisional government of France, under
Lamartine and Cavaignac, in 1848, a proposition was submitted
by France to the governments of the United States,
Great Britain and Russia, and which was subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
extended to King Leopold of Belgium, to create an "International
Board for Subterranean Exploration" in furtherance
of science, and in order, primarily, to test the truth
of the theory of igneous central fusion, first propounded by
Leibnitz, and afterward embraced by most of contemporary
geologists; but also with the further objects of ascertaining
the magnetic condition of the earth's crust, the variations
of the needle at great depths, and finally to set at rest the
doubts of some of the English mineralogists concerning the
permanency of the coal measures, about which considerable
alarm had been felt in all the manufacturing centers of
Europe.</p>

<p>The protocol of a quintuple treaty was finally drawn by
Prof. Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, and approved
by Sir Roderick Murchison, at that time President of the
Royal Society of Great Britain. To this project Arago lent
the weight of his great name, and Nesselrode affixed the
approval of Russia, it being one of the last official acts
performed by that veteran statesman.</p>

<p>The programme called for annual appropriations by each
of the above-named powers of 100,000 francs (about $20,000
each), the appointment of commissioners and a general
superintendent, the selection of a site for prosecuting the
undertaking, and a board of scientific visitors, consisting of
one member from each country.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings for the first
few months after the organization of the commission. Prof.
Watson, of Chicago, the author of a scientific treatise called
"Prairie Geology," was selected by President Fillmore, as
the first representative of the United States; Russia sent
Olgokoff; France, Ango Jeuno; England, Sir Edward
Sabine, the present President of the Royal Society; and
Belgium, Dr. Secchi, since so famous for his spectroscopic
observations on the fixed stars. These gentlemen, after
organizing at Paris, spent almost an entire year in traveling
before a site for the scene of operations was selected.
Finally, on the 10th of April, 1849, the first ground was
broken for actual work at Dudzeele, in the neighborhood of
Bruges, in the Kingdom of Belgium.</p>

<p>The considerations which led to the choice of this locality
were the following: First, it was the most central, regarding
the capitals of the parties to the protocol; secondly, it was
easy of access and connected by rail with Brussels, Paris and
St. Petersburg, and by line of steamers with London, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
situated within a short distance of the mouth of the Hond
or west Scheldt; thirdly, and perhaps as the most important
consideration of all, it was the seat of the deepest shaft in
the world, namely, the old salt mine at Dudzeele, which
had been worked from the time of the Romans down to the
commencement of the present century, at which time it was
abandoned, principally on account of the intense heat at
the bottom of the excavation, and which could not be entirely
overcome except by the most costly scientific appliances.</p>

<p>There was still another reason, which, in the estimation
of at least one member of the commission, Prof. Watson,
overrode them all&mdash;the exceptional increase of heat with
depth, which was its main characteristic.</p>

<p>The scientific facts upon which this great work was projected,
may be stated as follows: It is the opinion of the
principal modern geologists, based primarily upon the
hypothesis of Kant (that the solar universe was originally
an immense mass of incandescent vapor gradually cooled
and hardened after being thrown off from the grand central
body&mdash;afterward elaborated by La Place into the present
nebular hypothesis)&mdash;that "the globe was once in a state of
igneous fusion, and that as its heated mass began to cool,
an exterior crust was formed, first very thin, and afterward
gradually increasing until it attained its present thickness,
which has been variously estimated at from ten to two hundred
miles. During the process of gradual refrigeration,
some portions of the crust cooled more rapidly than others,
and the pressure on the interior igneous mass being unequal,
the heated matter or lava burst through the thinner parts,
and caused high-peaked mountains; the same cause also
producing all volcanic action." The arguments in favor of
this doctrine are almost innumerable; these are among the
most prominent:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The form of the earth is just that which an igneous
liquid mass would assume if thrown into an orbit with an
axial revolution similar to that of our earth. Not many
years ago Professor Faraday, assisted by Wheatstone, devised
a most ingenious apparatus by which, in the laboratory
of the Royal Society, he actually was enabled, by
injecting a flame into a vacuum, to exhibit visibly all the
phenomena of the formation of the solar universe, as contended
for by La Place and by Humboldt in his "Cosmos."</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> It is perfectly well ascertained that heat increases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
with depth, in all subterranean excavations. This
is the invariable rule in mining shafts, and preventive
measures must always be devised and used, by means generally
of air apparatus, to temper the heat as the depth
is augmented, else deep mining would have to be abandoned.
The rate of increase has been variously estimated
by different scientists in widely distant portions of the
globe. A few of them may be mentioned at this place,
since it was upon a total miscalculation on this head that
led to the present most deplorable results.</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Journal of Science</i>, in April, 1832, calculated
from results obtained in six of the deepest coal
mines in Durham and Northumberland, the mean rate of
increase at one degree of Fahrenheit for a descent of forty-four
English feet.</p>

<p>In this instance it is noticeable that the bulb of the thermometer
was introduced into cavities purposely cut into the
solid rock, at depths varying from two hundred to nine
hundred feet. The Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, as examined
by Mr. Fox, at the depth of thirteen hundred and
eighty feet, gave on average result of four degrees for every
seventy-five feet.</p>

<p>Kupffer compared results obtained from the silver mines
in Mexico, Peru and Freiburg, from the salt wells of
Saxony, and from the copper mines in the Caucasus,
together with an examination of the tin mines of Cornwall
and the coal mines in the north of England, and found the
average to be at least one degree of Fahrenheit for every
thirty-seven English feet. Cordier, on the contrary, considers
this amount somewhat overstated and reduces the
general average to one degree Centigrade for every twenty-five
metres, or about one degree of Fahrenheit for every
forty-five feet English measure.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> That the lavas taken from all parts of the
world, when subjected to chemical analysis, indicate that
they all proceed from a common source; and</p>

<p><i>Fourthly.</i> On no other hypothesis can we account for
the change of climate indicated by fossils.</p>

<p>The rate of increase of heat in the Dudzeele shaft was no
less than one degree Fahrenheit for every thirty feet English
measure.</p>

<p>At the time of recommencing sinking in the shaft on the
10th of April, 1849, the perpendicular depth was twenty-three
hundred and seventy feet, the thermometer marking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
forty-eight degrees Fahrenheit at the surface; this would
give the enormous heat of one hundred and twenty-seven
degrees Fahrenheit at the bottom of the mine. Of course,
without ventilation no human being could long survive in
such an atmosphere, and the first operations of the commission
were directed to remedy this inconvenience.</p></div>

<p>The report then proceeds to give the details of a
very successful contrivance for forcing air into the
shaft at the greatest depths, only a portion of which do
we deem it important to quote, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The width of the Moer-Vater, or Lieve, at this point,
was ten hundred and eighty yards, and spanned by an old
bridge, the stone piers of which were very near together,
having been built by the emperor Hadrian in the early part
of the second century. The rise of the tide in the North
Sea, close at hand, was from fifteen to eighteen feet, thus
producing a current almost as rapid as that of the Mersey
at Liverpool. The commissioners determined to utilize
this force, in preference to the erection of expensive steam
works at the mouth of the mine. A plan was submitted
by Cyrus W. Field, and at once adopted. Turbine wheels
were built, covering the space betwixt each arch, movable,
and adapted to the rise and fall of the tide. Gates were
also constructed between each arch, and a head of water,
ranging from ten to fifteen feet fall, provided for each turn
of the tide&mdash;both in the ebb and the flow, so that there
should be a continuous motion to the machinery. Near the
mouth of the shaft two large boiler-iron reservoirs were
constructed, capable of holding from one hundred and fifty
thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of compressed
air, the average rate of condensation being about two hundred
atmospheres. These reservoirs were properly connected
with the pumping apparatus of the bridge by large
cast-iron mains, so that the supply was continuous, and at
an almost nominal cost. It was by the same power of
compressed air that the tunneling through Mount St. Gothard
was effected for the Lyons and Turin Railway, just
completed.</p>

<p>The first operations were to enlarge the shaft so as to
form an opening forty by one hundred feet, English measure.
This consumed the greater part of the year 1849, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
that the real work of sinking was not fairly under way
until early in 1850. But from that period down to the
memorable 5th of November, 1872, the excavation steadily
progressed. I neglected to state at the outset that M. Jean
Dusoloy, the state engineer of Belgium, was appointed
General Superintendent, and continued to fill that important
office until he lost his life, on the morning of the 6th
of November, the melancholly details of which are hereinafter
fully narrated.</p>

<p>As the deepening progressed the heat of the bottom continued
to increase, but it was soon observed in a different
ratio from the calculations of the experts. After attaining
the depth of fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty feet,&mdash;about
the height of Mt. Blanc&mdash;which was reached early
in 1864, it was noticed, for the first time, that the laws of
temperature and gravitation were synchronous; that is, that
the heat augmented in a ratio proportioned to the square of
the distance from the surface downward. Hence the increase
at great depths bore no relation at all to the apparently
gradual augmentation near the surface. As early as
June, 1868, it became apparent that the sinking, if carried
on at all, would have to be protected by some atheromatous
or adiathermic covering. Professor Tyndall was applied to,
and, at the request of Lord Palmerston, made a vast number
of experiments on non-conducting bodies. As the
result of his labors, he prepared a compound solution about
the density of common white lead, composed of selenite
alum and sulphate of copper, which was laid on three or
four thicknesses, first upon the bodies of the naked miners&mdash;for
in all deep mines the operatives work <i>in puris naturalibus</i>&mdash;and
then upon an oval-shaped cage made of papier
mache, with a false bottom, enclosed within which the
miners were enabled to endure the intense heat for a shift
of two hours each day. The drilling was all done by
means of the diamond-pointed instrument, and the blasting
by nitro-glycerine from the outset; so that the principal
labor consisted in shoveling up the debris and keeping the
drill-point <i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further it may not be improper to enumerate
a few of the more important scientific facts which,
up to the 1st of November of the past year, had been satisfactorily
established. First in importance is the one
alluded to above&mdash;the rate of increase of temperature as we
descend into the bowels of the earth. This law, shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
above to correspond exactly with the law of attraction or
gravitation, had been entirely overlooked by all the scientists,
living or dead. No one had for a moment suspected
that heat followed the universal law of physics as a material
body ought to do, simply because, from the time of De
Saussure, heat had been regarded only as a force or <i>vis viva</i>
and not as a ponderable quality.</p>

<p>But not only was heat found to be subject to the law
of inverse ratio of the square of the distance from the surface,
but the atmosphere itself followed the same invariable
rule. Thus, while we know that water boils at the level of
the sea at two hundred and twelve degrees Fahrenheit, it
readily vaporizes at one hundred and eighty-five degrees on
the peak of Teneriffe, only fifteen thousand feet above that
level. This, we know, is owing to the weight of the superincumbent
atmosphere, there being a heavier burden at the
surface than at any height above it. The rate of decrease
above the surface is perfectly regular, being one degree for
every five hundred and ninety feet of ascent. But the
amazing fact was shown that the weight of the atmosphere
increased in a ratio proportioned to the square of the distance
downward.... The magnetic needle
also evinced some curious disturbance, the dip being invariably
upward. Its action also was exceedingly feeble, and
the day before the operations ceased it lost all polarity
whatever, and the finest magnet would not meander from
the point of the compass it happened to be left at for the
time being. As Sir Edward Sabine finely said, "The hands
of the magnetic clock stopped." But the activity of the
needle gradually increased as the surface was approached.</p>

<p>All electrical action also ceased, which fully confirms the
theory, of Professor Faraday, that "electricity is a force
generated by the rapid axial revolution of the earth, and that
magnetic attraction in all cases points or operates at right
angles to its current." Hence electricity, from the nature
of its cause, must be superficial.</p>

<p>Every appearance of water disappeared at the depth of
only 9000 feet. From this depth downward the rock was
of a basaltic character, having not the slightest appearance
of granite formation&mdash;confirming, in a most remarkable
manner, the discovery made only last year, that all <i>granites</i>
are of <i>aqueous</i>, instead of <i>igneous</i> deposition. As a corollary
from the law of atmospheric pressure, it was found
utterly impossible to vaporize water at a greater depth than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
24,000 feet, which point was reached in 1869. No amount
of heat affected it in the least perceptible manner, and on
weighing the liquid at the greatest depth attained, by means
of a nicely adjusted scale, it was found to be of a density
expressed thus: 198,073, being two degrees or integers of
atomic weight heavier than gold, at the surface.</p></div>

<p>The report then proceeds to discuss the question of
the true figure of the earth, whether an oblate spheroid,
as generally supposed, or only truncated at the poles;
the length of a degree of longitude at the latitude of
Dudzeele, 51 deg. 20 min. N., and one or two other
problems. The concluding portion of the report is reproduced
in full.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For the past twelve months it was found impossible to
endure the heat, even sheltered as the miners were by the
atmospheric cover and cage, for more than fifteen minutes at
a time, so that the expense of sinking had increased geometrically
for the past two years. However, important
results had been obtained, and a perpendicular depth
reached many thousands of feet below the deepest sea
soundings of Lieutenant Brooks. In fact, the enormous
excavation, on the 1st of November, 1872, measured perpendicularly,
no less than 37,810 feet and 6 inches from the
floor of the shaft building! The highest peak of the Himalayas
is only little over 28,000 feet, so that it can at once
be seen that no time had been thrown away by the Commissioners
since the inception of the undertaking, in April,
1849.</p>

<p>The first symptoms of alarm were felt on the evening of
November 1. The men complained of a vast increase of
heat, and the cages had to be dropped every five minutes
for the greater part of the night; and of those who attempted
to work, at least one half were extricated in a condition of
fainting, but one degree from cyncope. Toward morning,
hoarse, profound and frequent subterranean explosions were
heard, which had increased at noon to one dull, threatening
and continuous roar. But the miners went down bravely
to their tasks, and resolved to work as long as human endurance
could bear it. But this was not to be much longer;
for late at night, on the 4th, after hearing a terrible explosion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
which shook the whole neighborhood, a hot sirocco
issued from the bottom, which drove them all out in a state
of asphyxia. The heat at the surface became absolutely
unendurable, and on sending down a cage with only a dog
in it, the materials of which it was composed took fire, and
the animal perished in the flames. At 3 o'clock <span class="smsmcap">a. m.</span> the
iron fastenings to another cage were found fused, and the
wire ropes were melted for more than 1000 feet at the other
end. The detonations became more frequent, the trembling
of the earth at the surface more violent, and the heat more
oppressive around the mouth of the orifice. A few minutes
before 4 o'clock a subterranean crash was heard, louder than
Alpine thunder, and immediately afterward a furious cloud
of ashes, smoke and gaseous exhalation shot high up into
the still darkened atmosphere of night. At this time at least
one thousand of the terrified and half-naked inhabitants of
the neighboring village of Dudzeele had collected on the
spot, and with wringing hands and fearful outcries bewailed
their fate, and threatened instant death to the officers of the
commission, and even to the now terrified miners. Finally,
just before dawn, on the 5th of November, or, to be more
precise, at exactly twenty minutes past 6 <span class="smsmcap">a. m.</span>, molten lava
made its appearance at the surface!</p>

<p>The fright now became general, and as the burning buildings
shed their ominous glare around, and the languid
stream of liquid fire slowly bubbled up and rolled toward
the canal, the scene assumed an aspect of awful sublimity
and grandeur. The plains around were lit up for many
leagues, and the foggy skies intensified and reduplicated
the effects of the illumination. Toward sunrise the flow
of lava was suspended for nearly an hour, but shortly after
ten o'clock it suddenly increased its volume, and, as it
cooled, formed a sort of saucer-shaped funnel, over the
edges of which it boiled up, broke, and ran off in every
direction. It was at this period that the accomplished
Dusoloy, so long the Superintendent, lost his life. As the
lava slowly meandered along, he attempted to cross the
stream by stepping from one mass of surface cinders to
another. Making a false step, the floating rock upon which
he sprang suddenly turned over, and before relief could be
afforded his body was consumed to a crisp. I regret to add
that his fate kindled no sympathy among the assembled
multitude; but they rudely seized his mutilated remains,
and amid jeers, execrations, and shouts of triumph, attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
a large stone to the half-consumed corpse and precipitated
it into the canal. Thus are the heroes of science frequently
sacrificed to the fury of a plebeian mob.</p>

<p>It would afford me a pleasure to inform the department
that the unforeseen evils of our scientific convention terminated
here. But I regret to add that such is very far from
being the case. Indeed, from the appearance of affairs
this morning at the volcanic crater&mdash;for such it has now
become&mdash;the possible evils are almost incalculable. The
Belgian Government was duly notified by telegraph of the
death of the Superintendent and the mutinous disposition
of the common people about Bruges, and early on the
morning of the 6th of November a squad of flying horse
was dispatched to the spot to maintain order. But this
interference only made matters worse. The discontent, augmented
by the wildest panic, became universal, and the
mob reigned supreme. Nor could the poor wretches be
greatly condemned; for toward evening the lava current
reached the confines of the old village of Dudzeele, and
about midnight set the town on fire. The lurid glare of
the conflagration awakened the old burghers of Bruges
from their slumbers and spread consternation in the city,
though distant several miles from the spot. A meeting was
called at the Guildhall at dawn, and the wildest excitement
prevailed. But after hearing explanations from the
members of the commission, the populace quietly but doggedly
dispersed. The government from this time forward
did all that power and prudence combined could effect to
quell the reign of terror around Bruges. In this country
the telegraph, being a government monopoly, has been
rigorously watched and a cordon of military posts established
around the threatened district, so that it has been
almost impossible to convey intelligence of this disaster
beyond the limits of the danger. In the mean time, a congress
of the most experienced scientists was invited to the
scene for the purpose of suggesting some remedy against
the prospective spread of the devastation. The first meeting
took place at the old Guildhall in Bruges and was
strictly private, none being admitted except the diplomatic
representatives of foreign governments, and the members
elect of the college. As in duty bound, I felt called on to
attend, and shall in this place attempt a short synopsis of
the proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>Professor Palmieri, of Naples, presided, and Dr. Kirchoff
officiated as secretary.</p>

<p>Gassiot, of Paris, was the first speaker, and contended
that the theory of nucleatic fusion, now being fully established
it only remained to prescribe the laws governing its
superficial action. "There is but one law applicable, that
I am aware of," said he, "and that is the law which drives
from the center of a revolving body all fluid matter toward
the circumference, and forcibly ejects it into space, if possible,
in the same manner that a common grindstone in
rapid motion will drive off from its rim drops of water or
other foreign unattached matter. Thus, whenever we find
a vent or open orifice, as in the craters of active volcanoes,
the incandescent lava boils up and frequently overflows the
top of the highest peak of the Andes."</p>

<p>Palmieri then asked the speaker "if he wished to be
understood as expressing the unqualified opinion that an
orifice once being opened would continue to flow forever,
and that there was no law governing the quantity or regulating
the level to which it could rise?"</p>

<p>Gassiot replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan philosopher then added: "I dissent <i>in
toto</i> from the opinion of M. Gassiot. For more than a quarter
of a century I have studied the lava-flows of Vesuvius,
tna and Stromboli, and I can assure the Congress that
the Creator has left no such flaw in His mechanism of the
globe. The truth is, that molten lava can only rise about
21,000 feet above the level of the sea, owing to the balance-wheel
of terrestrial gravitation, which counteracts at that
height all centrifugal energy. Were this not so, the entire
contents of the globe would gush from the incandescent
center and fly off into surrounding space."</p>

<p>M. Gassiot replied, "that true volcanoes were supplied by
nature with <i>circumvalvular lips</i>, and hence, after filling their
craters, they ceased to flow. But in the instance before us
no such provision existed, and the only protection which he
could conceive of consisted in the smallness of the orifice;
and he would therefore recommend his Majesty King Leopold
to direct all his efforts to confine the aperture to its
present size."</p>

<p>Palmieri again responded, "that he had no doubt but
that the crater at Dudzeele would continue to flow until it
had built up around itself basaltic walls to the height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of feet, and that the
idea of setting bounds to the size of the mouth of the
excavation was simply ridiculous."</p>

<p>Gassiot interrupted, and was about to answer in a very
excited tone, when Prof. Palmieri "disclaimed any intention
of personal insult, but spoke from a scientific standpoint."
He then proceeded: "The lava bed of Mount
tna maintains a normal level of 7000 feet, while Vesuvius
calmly reposes at a little more than one half that altitude.
On the other hand, according to Prof. Whitney, of the
Pacific Survey, Mount Kilauea, in the Sandwich Islands,
bubbles up to the enormous height of 17,000 feet. It cannot
be contended that the crater of Vesuvius is not a true
nucleatic orifice, because I have demonstrated that the
molten bed regularly rises and falls like the tides of the
ocean when controlled by the moon." It was seen at once
that the scientists present were totally unprepared to discuss
the question in its novel and most important aspects;
and on taking a vote, at the close of the session, the members
were equally divided between the opinions of Gassiot
and Palmieri. A further session will take place on the
arrival of Prof. Tyndall, who has been telegraphed for
from New York, and of the great Russian geologist and
astronomer, Tugenieff.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the damage already done may be summed
up as follows: The destruction of the Bruges and Hond
Canal by the formation of a basaltic dyke across it more
than two hundred feet wide, the burning of Dudzeele, and
the devastation of about thirty thousand acres of valuable
land. At the same time it is utterly impossible to predict
where the damage may stop, inasmuch as early this morning
the mouth of the crater had fallen in, and the flowing
stream had more than doubled in size.</p>

<p>In consideration of the part hitherto taken by the Government
of the United States in originating the work that
led to the catastrophe, and by request of M. Musenheim,
the Belgian Foreign Secretary, I have taken the liberty of
drawing upon the State Department for eighty-seven thousand
dollars, being the sum agreed to be paid for the cost
of emigration to the United States of two hundred families
(our own pro rata) rendered homeless by the conflagration
of Dudzeele.</p>

<p>I am this moment in receipt of your telegram dated yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and rejoice to learn that Prof. Agassiz has returned
from the South Seas, and will be sent forward without
delay.</p>

<p>With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient
servant,</p>

<p class="sig"><span style="padding-right: 2em;">J<span class="smsmcap">ohn</span> F<span class="smsmcap">lannagan</span>,</span><br />
United States Consul at Bruges.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Since concluding the above dispatch, Professor
Palmieri did me the honor of a special call, and, after some
desultory conversation, approached the all-absorbing topic
of the day, and cautiously expressed his opinion as follows:
Explaining his theory, as announced at the Congress, he
said that "Holland, Belgium, and Denmark, being all low
countries, some portions of each lying below the sea-level,
he would not be surprised if the present outflow of lava
devastated them all, and covered the bottom of the North
Sea for many square leagues with a bed of basalt." The
reason given was this: "That lava must continue to flow
until, by its own action, it builds up around the volcanic
crater a rim or cone high enough to afford a counterpoise
to the centrifugal tendency of axial energy; and that, as
the earth's crust was demonstrated to be exceptionally thin
in the north of Europe, the height required in this instance
would be so great that an enormous lapse of time must
ensue before the self-created cone could obtain the necessary
altitude. Before <i>tna</i> attained its present secure
height, it devastated an area as large as France; and Prof.
Whitney has demonstrated that some center of volcanic
action, now extinct, in the State of California, threw out a
stream that covered a much greater surface, as the basaltic
table mountains, vulgarly so called, extend north and south
for a distance as great as from Moscow to Rome." In concluding
his remarks, he ventured the prediction that "the
North Sea would be completely filled up, and the British
Islands again connected with the Continent."</p>

<h3><i>WHITHERWARD.</i></h3>


<p class="cap">By pursuing the analogies of nature, the human
mind reduces to order the vagaries of the imagination,
and bodies them forth in forms of loveliness and
in similitudes of heaven.</p>

<p>By an irrevocable decree of Nature's God, all his works
are progressive in the direction of himself. This law
is traceable from the molehill up to the mountain,
from the mite up to the man. Geology, speaking to us
from the depths of a past eternity, from annals inscribed
upon the imperishable rock, utters not one syllable to
contradict this tremendous truth. Millions of ages ago,
she commenced her impartial record, and as we unroll
it to-day, from the coal-bed and the marble quarry, we
read in creation's dawn as plainly as we behold in
operation around us, the mighty decree&mdash;<span class="smcap">Onward and
Upward, Forever!</span></p>

<p>In the shadowy past this majestic globe floated
through the blue ether, a boiling flood of lava. The
elements were then unborn. Time was not; for as yet
the golden laws of Kepler had not emerged from chaos.
The sun had not hemmed his bright-eyed daughters in,
nor marked out on the azure concave the paths they
were to tread. The planets were not worlds, but shot
around the lurid center liquid masses of flame and desolation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Comets sported at random through the sky,
and trailed after them their horrid skirts of fire. The
Spirit of God had not "moved upon the face of the
waters," and rosy Chaos still held the scepter in his
hand. But changes were at work. As the coral worm
toils on in the unfathomable depths of ocean, laying in
secret the foundations of mighty continents, destined
as the ages roll by to emerge into light and grandeur,
so the laws of the universe carried on their everlasting
work.</p>

<p>An eternity elapsed, and the age of fire passed away.
A new era dawned upon the earth. The gases were
generated, and the elements of air and water overspread
the globe. Islands began to appear, at first presenting
pinnacles of bare and blasted granite; but gradually, by
decay and decomposition, changing into dank marshes
and fertile plains.</p>

<p>One after another the sensational universe now springs
into being. This but prepared the way for the animated,
and that in turn formed the groundwork and basis for
the human. Man then came forth, the result of all her
previous efforts&mdash;nature's pet, her paragon and her
pride.</p>

<p>Reason sits enthroned upon his brow, and the soul
wraps its sweet affections about his heart; angels spread
their wings above him, and God calls him His child.
He treads the earth its acknowledged monarch, and
commences its subjection. One by one the elements
have yielded to his sway, nature has revealed her hoariest
secrets to his ken, and heaven thrown wide its portals
to his spirit. He stands now upon the very acme
of the visible creation, and with straining eye, and
listening ear, and anxious heart, whispers to himself
that terrific and tremendous word&mdash;<span class="smcap">Whitherward!</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>Late one afternoon in April, I was sitting on the
grassy slope of Telegraph Hill, watching the waves of
sunset as they rolled in from the west, and broke in
crimson spray upon the peaks of the Contra Costa hills.
I was alone; and, as my custom is, was ruminating upon
the grand problem of futurity. The broad and beautiful
bay spread out like a sea of silver at my feet, and
the distant mountains, reflecting the rays of the setting
sun, seemed to hem it in with barriers of gold. The
city lay like a tired infant at evening in its mother's
arms, and only at intervals disturbed my reflections by
its expiring sobs. The hours of business I well knew
had passed, and the heavy iron door had long since
grated on its hinges, and the fire-proof shutter been
bolted for the night. But I felt that my labors had
just commenced. The duties of my profession had
swallowed up thought throughout the long hours devoted
to the cares of life, and it was not until I was
released from their thraldom that I found myself in
truth a slave. The one master-thought came back into
my brain, until it burned its hideous image there in
letters of fire&mdash;<span class="smcap">Whitherward! Whitherward!</span></p>

<p>The past came up before me with its long memories
of Egyptian grandeur, with its triumphs of Grecian
art, with its burden of Roman glory. Italy came with
her republics, her "starry" Galileo, and her immortal
Buonarotti. France flashed by, with her garments
dyed in blood, and her Napoleons in chains. England
rose up with her arts and her arms, her commerce and
her civilization, her splendor and her shame. I beheld
Newton gazing at the stars, heard Milton singing of
Paradise, and saw Russell expiring on the scaffold. But
ever and anon a pale, thorn-crowned monarch, arrayed
in mock-purple, and bending beneath a cross, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
start forth at my side, and with uplifted eye, but speechless
lip, point with one hand to the pages of a volume
I had open on my knee, and with the other to the blue
heaven above. Judea would then pass with solemn
tread before me. Her patriarchs, her prophets and her
apostles, her judges, her kings, and her people, one by
one came and went like the phantasmagoria of a dream.
The present then rose up in glittering robes, its feet
resting upon the mounds of Nimrod, its brow encircled
with a coronet of stars, pillaging, with one hand,
the cloud above of its lightnings, and sending them
forth with the other, bridled and subdued, to the uttermost
ends of the earth.</p>

<p>But this was not all. Earth's physical history also
swept by in full review. All nature lent her stores, and
with an effort of mind, by no means uncommon for
those who have long thought upon a single subject, I
seemed to possess the power to generalize all that I had
ever heard, read or seen, into one gorgeous picture, and
hang it up in the wide heavens before me.</p>

<p>The actual scenery around me entirely disappeared,
and I beheld an immense pyramid of alabaster, reared
to the very stars, upon whose sides I saw inscribed a
faithful history of the past. Its foundations were in
deep shadow, but the light gradually increased toward
the top, until its summit was bathed in the most refulgent
lustre.</p>

<p>Inscribed in golden letters I read on one of its sides
these words, in alternate layers, rising gradually to the
apex: "<i>Granite</i>, <i>Liquid</i>, <i>Gas</i>, <i>Electricity;</i>" on another,
"<i>Inorganic</i>, <i>Vegetable</i>, <i>Animal</i>, <i>Human;</i>" on the third
side, "<i>Consciousness</i>, <i>Memory</i>, <i>Reason</i>, <i>Imagination;</i>"
and on the fourth, "<i>Chaos</i>, <i>Order</i>, <i>Harmony</i>, <i>Love</i>."</p>

<p>At this moment I beheld the figure of a human being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
standing at the base of the pyramid, and gazing intently
upward. He then placed his foot upon the foundation,
and commenced climbing toward the summit. I caught
a distinct view of his features, and perceived that they
were black and swarthy like those of the most depraved
Hottentot. He toiled slowly upward, and as he passed
the first layer, he again looked toward me, and I observed
that his features had undergone a complete
transformation. They now resembled those of an
American Indian. He passed the second layer; and as
he entered the third, once more presented his face to
me for observation. Another change had overspread
it, and I readily recognized in him the tawny native of
Malacca or Hindoostan. As he reached the last layer,
and entered its region of refulgent light, I caught a full
glimpse of his form and features, and beheld the high
forehead, the glossy ringlets, the hazel eye, and the
alabaster skin of the true Caucasian.</p>

<p>I now observed for the first time that the pyramid
was left unfinished, and that its summit, instead of presenting
a well-defined peak, was in reality a level plain.
In a few moments more, the figure I had traced from
the base to the fourth layer, reached the apex, and
stood with folded arms and upraised brow upon the
very summit. His lips parted as if about to speak,
and as I leaned forward to hear, I caught, in distinct
tone and thrilling accent, that word which had so often
risen to my own lips for utterance, and seared my very
brain, because unanswered&mdash;<span class="smcap">Whitherward!</span></p>

<p>"Whitherward, indeed!" exclaimed I, aloud, shuddering
at the sepulchral sound of my voice. "Home,"
responded a tiny voice at my side, and turning suddenly
around, my eyes met those of a sweet little school-girl,
with a basket of flowers upon her arm, who had approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
me unobserved, and who evidently imagined
I had addressed her when I spoke. "Yes, little daughter,"
replied I, "'tis time to proceed homeward, for
the sun has ceased to gild the summit of Diavolo, and
the evening star is visible in the west. I will attend
you home," and taking her proffered hand, I descended
the hill, with the dreadful word still ringing in my ears,
and the fadeless vision still glowing in my heart.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Midnight had come and gone, and still the book lay
open on my knee. The candle had burned down close
to the socket, and threw a flickering glimmer around
my chamber; but no indications of fatigue or slumber
visited my eyelids. My temples throbbed heavily, and
I felt the hot and excited blood playing like the piston-rod
of an engine between my heart and brain.</p>

<p>I had launched forth on the broad ocean of speculation,
and now perceived, when too late, the perils of
my situation. Above me were dense and lowering
clouds, which no eye could penetrate; around me howling
tempests, which no voice could quell; beneath me
heaving billows, which no oil could calm. I thought of
Plato struggling with his doubts; of Epicurus sinking
beneath them; of Socrates swallowing his poison; of
Cicero surrendering himself to despair. I remembered
how all the great souls of the earth had staggered
beneath the burden of the same thought, which weighed
like a thousand Cordilleras upon my own; and as I
pressed my hand upon my burning brow, I cried again
and again&mdash;<span class="smcap">Whitherward! Whitherward!</span></p>

<p>I could find no relief in philosophy; for I knew her
maxims by heart from Zeno and the Stagirite down to
Berkeley and Cousin. I had followed her into all her
hiding-places, and courted her in all her moods. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
coquette was ever half so false, so fickle, and so fair.
Her robes are woven of the sunbeams, and a star
adorns her brow; but she sits impassive upon her icy
throne, and wields no scepter but despair. The light
she throws around is not the clear gleam of the sunshine,
nor the bright twinkle of the star; but glances
in fitful glimmerings on the soul, like the aurora on the
icebergs of the pole, and lightens up the scene only to
show its utter desolation.</p>

<p>The Bible lay open before me, but I could find no
comfort there. Its lessons were intended only for the
meek and humble, and my heart was cased in pride.
It reached only to the believing; I was tossed on an
ocean of doubt. It required, as a condition to faith,
the innocence of an angel and the humility of a child;
I had long ago seared my conscience by mingling in
the busy scenes of life, and was proud of my mental
acquirements. The Bible spoke comfort to the Publican;
I was of the straight sect of the Pharisees. Its
promises were directed to the poor in spirit, whilst
mine panted for renown.</p>

<p>At this moment, whilst heedlessly turning over its
leaves and scarcely glancing at their contents, my attention
was arrested by this remarkable passage in one of
Paul's epistles: "That was not <i>first</i> which is spiritual,
but that which was natural, and <i>afterward</i> that which
is spiritual. Behold, I show you a mystery: <i>we shall
not all sleep</i>, but we shall all be changed, in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump."</p>

<p>Again and again I read this text, for it promised more
by reflection than at first appeared in the words. Slowly
a light broke in on the horizon's verge, and I felt, for
the first time in my whole life, that the past was not all
inexplicable, nor the future a chaos, but that the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
soul, lit up by the torch of science! and guided by the
prophecies of Holy Writ, might predict the path it is
destined to tread, and read in advance the history of
its final enfranchisement. St. Paul evidently intended
to teach the doctrine of <i>progress</i>, even in its applicability
to man. He did not belong to that narrow-minded
sect in philosophy, which declares that the
earth and the heavens are finished; that man is the
crowning glory of his Maker, and the utmost stretch of
His creative power; that henceforth the globe which he
inhabits is barren, and can produce no being superior
to himself. On the contrary, he clearly intended to
teach the same great truth which modern science is
demonstrating to all the world, that progression is
nature's first law, and that even in the human kingdom
the irrevocable decree has gone forth&mdash;<span class="smcap">Onward and
Upward, Forever!</span></p>

<p>Such were my reflections when the last glimmer of
the candle flashed up like a meteor, and then as suddenly
expired in night. I was glad that the shadows
were gone. Better, thought I, is utter darkness than
that poor flame which renders it visible. But I had
suddenly grown rich in thought. A clue had been furnished
to the labyrinth in which I had wandered from
a child; a hint had been planted in the mind which it
would be impossible ever to circumscribe or extinguish.
One letter had been identified by which, like Champollion
le Jeune, I could eventually decipher the inscription
on the pyramid. What are these spectral apparitions
which rear themselves in the human mind, and
are called by mortals <i>hints?</i> Whence do they come?
Who lodges them in the chambers of the mind, where
they sprout and germinate, and bud and blossom, and
bear?</p>

caught another, as it was whispered by the winds, and
they wafted him to the shores of a New World. Franklin
beheld one flash forth from the cloud, and he traced
the lightnings to their bourn. Another dropped from
the skies into the brain of Leverrier, and he scaled the
very heavens, till he unburied a star.</p>

<p>Rapidly was my mind working out the solution of the
problem which had so long tortured it, based upon the
intimation it had derived from St. Paul's epistle, when
most unexpectedly, and at the same time most unwelcomely,
I fell into one of those strange moods which
can neither be called sleep nor consciousness, but which
leave their impress far more powerfully than the visions
of the night or the events of the day.</p>

<p>I beheld a small egg, most beautifully dotted over,
and stained. Whilst my eye rested on it, it cracked;
an opening was made <i>from within</i>, and almost immediately
afterward a bird of glittering plumage and
mocking song flew out, and perched on the bough of a
rose-tree, beneath whose shadow I found myself reclining.
Before my surprise had vanished, I beheld a
painted worm at my feet, crawling toward the root of
the tree which was blooming above me. It soon
reached the trunk, climbed into the branches, and
commenced spinning its cocoon. Hardly had it finished
its silken home, ere it came forth in the form of a gorgeous
butterfly, and, spreading its wings, mounted toward
the heavens. Quickly succeeding this, the same
pyramid of alabaster, which I had seen from the summit
of Telegraph Hill late in the afternoon, rose gradually
upon the view. It was in nowise changed; the inscriptions
on the sides were the same, and the identical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
figure stood with folded arms and uplifted brow upon
the top. I now heard a rushing sound, such as stuns
the ear at Niagara, or greets it during a hurricane at
sea, when the shrouds of the ship are whistling to the
blast, and the flashing billows are dashing against her
sides.</p>

<p>Suddenly the pyramid commenced changing its form,
and before many moments elapsed it had assumed the
rotundity of a globe, and I beheld it covered with seas,
and hills, and lakes, and mountains, and plains, and fertile
fields. But the human figure still stood upon its
crest. Then came forth the single blast of a bugle,
such as the soldier hears on the morn of a world-changing
battle. Csar heard it at Pharsalia, Titus at Jerusalem,
Washington at Yorktown, and Wellington at
Waterloo.</p>

<p>No lightning flash ever rended forest king from crest
to root quicker than the transformation which now overspread
the earth. In a second of time it became as
transparent as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun. But
in every other respect it preserved its identity. On
casting my eyes toward the human being, I perceived
that he still preserved his position, but his feet did not
seem to touch the earth. He appeared to be floating
upon its arch, as the halcyon floats in the atmosphere.
His features were lit up with a heavenly radiance, and
assumed an expression of superhuman beauty.</p>

<p>The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?
As sudden as the question came forth the response, "I
am." But, inquired my mind, for my lips did not
move, you have never passed the portals of the grave?
Again I read in his features the answer, "For ages this
earth existed as a natural body, and all its inhabitants
partook of its characteristics; gradually it approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the spiritual state, and by a law like that which transforms
the egg into the songster, or the worm into the
butterfly, it has just accomplished one of its mighty
cycles, and now gleams forth with the refulgence of the
stars. I did not die, but passed as naturally into the
spiritual world as the huge earth itself. Prophets and
apostles predicted this change many hundred years ago;
but the blind infatuation of our race did not permit
them to realize its truth. Your own mind, in common
with the sages of all time, long brooded over the idea,
and oftentimes have you exclaimed, in agony and dismay&mdash;<span class="smcap">Whitherward!
Whitherward!</span></p>

<p>"The question is now solved. The revolution may
not come in the year allotted you, but so surely as St.
Paul spoke inspiration, so surely as science elicits truth,
so surely as the past prognosticates the future, the
natural world must pass into the spiritual, and everything
be changed in the twinkling of an eye. Watch
well! your own ears may hear the clarion note, your
own eyes witness the transfiguration."</p>

<p>Slowly the vision faded away, and left me straining
my gaze into the dark midnight which now shrouded
the world, and endeavoring to calm my heart, which
throbbed as audibly as the hollow echoes of a drum.
When the morning sun peeped over the Contra Costa
range, I still sat silent and abstracted in my chair, revolving
over the incidents of the night, but thankful
that, though the reason is powerless to brush away the
clouds which obscure the future, yet the imagination
may spread its wings, and, soaring into the heavens
beyond them, answer the soul when in terror she inquires&mdash;<span class="smcap">Whitherward!</span></p>

<h2>XVIII.</h2>

<h3><i>A PAIR OF MYTHS:</i></h3>

<p class="secsc">BEING A CHAPTER FROM AN UNPUBLISHED WORK.</p>

<p class="cap">Eight days passed away unreckoned, and still I remained
unconscious of everything occurring around
me. The morning of the ninth dawned, dragged heavily
along, and noon approached, whilst I lay in the same
comatose state. No alteration had taken place, except
that a deeper and sounder sleep seemed to have seized
upon me; a symptom hailed by my physician with joy,
but regarded by my mother with increased alarm.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the incautious closing of my chamber
door, as my sister, Miss Lucy Stanly, then in her
fifteenth year, entered the apartment, aroused me from
slumber and oblivion.</p>

<p>Abed at noonday! What did it betoken? I endeavored
to recall something of the past, but memory for a
long time refused its aid, and I appeared as fatally and
irremediably unconscious as ever. Gradually, however,
my shattered mind recovered its faculties, and in less
than an hour after my awakening, I felt perfectly restored.
No pain tormented me, and no torpor benumbed
my faculties. I rapidly reviewed, mentally, the occurrences
of the day before, when, as I imagined, the
disaster had happened, and resolved at once to rise
from my bed and prosecute my intended journey.</p>

<p>At this moment my father entered the apartment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
and observing that I was awake, ventured to speak to
me kindly and in a very low tone. I smiled at his
uneasiness, and immediately relieved him from all
apprehension, by conversing freely and intelligibly of
the late catastrophe. His delight knew no bounds.
He seized my hand a thousand times, and pressed it
again and again to his lips. At length, remembering
that my mother was ignorant of my complete restoration,
he rushed from the room, in order to be the first
to convey the welcome intelligence.</p>

<p>My bed was soon surrounded by the whole family,
chattering away, wild with joy, and imprinting scores
of kisses on my lips, cheeks and forehead. The excitement
proved too severe for me in my weak condition,
and had not the timely arrival of the physician intervened
to clear my chamber of every intruder, except
Mamma Betty, as we all called the nurse, these pages in
all probability would never have arrested the reader's
eye. As it was, I suddenly grew very sick and faint;
everything around me assumed a deep green tinge, and
I fell into a deathlike swoon.</p>

<p>Another morning's sun was shining cheerily in at
my window, when consciousness again returned. The
doctor was soon at my side, and instead of prescribing
physic as a remedy, requested my sister to sit at my
bedside, and read in a low tone any interesting little
story she might select. He cautioned her not to mention,
even in the most casual manner, <i>Mormonism</i>, <i>St.
Louis</i>, or the <i>Moselle</i>, which order she most implicitly
obeyed; nor could all my ingenuity extract a solitary
remark in relation to either.</p>

<p>My sister was not very long in making a selection;
for, supposing what delighted herself would not fail
to amuse me, she brought in a manuscript, carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
folded, and proceeded at once to narrate its history.
It was written by my father, as a sort of model or
sampler for my brothers and sisters, which they were
to imitate when composition-day came round, instead of
"hammering away," as he called it, on moral essays
and metaphysical commonplaces. It was styled</p>


<p class="secsc">THE KING OF THE NINE-PINS: A MYTH.</p>

<p>Heinrich Schwarz, or Black Hal, as he was wont to
be called, was an old toper, but he was possessed of
infinite good humor, and related a great many very
queer stories, the truth of which no one, that I ever
heard of, had the hardihood to doubt; for Black Hal
had an uncommon share of "Teutonic pluck" about
him, and was at times very unceremonious in the display
of it. But Hal had a weakness&mdash;it was not liquor, for
that was his strength&mdash;which he never denied; <i>Hal was
too fond of nine-pins</i>. He had told me, in confidence,
that "many a time and oft" he had rolled incessantly
for weeks together. I think I heard him say that he
once rolled for a month, day and night, without stopping
a single moment to eat or to drink, or even to
catch his breath.</p>

<p>I did not question his veracity at the time; but since,
on reflection, the fact seems almost incredible; and
were it not that this sketch might accidentally fall in
his way, I might be tempted to show philosophically
that such a thing could not possibly be. And yet I
have read of very long fasts in my day&mdash;that, for
instance, of Captain Riley in the Great Sahara, and
others, which will readily occur to the reader. But I
must not episodize, or I shall not reach my story.</p>

<p>Black Hal was sitting late one afternoon in a Nine-Pin
Alley, in the little town of Kaatskill, in the State of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
New York&mdash;it is true, for he said so&mdash;when a tremendous
thunder-storm invested his retreat. His companions,
one by one, had left him, until, rising from
his seat and gazing around, he discovered that he was
alone. The alley-keeper, too, could nowhere be found,
and the boys who were employed to set up the pins had
disappeared with the rest. It was growing very late,
and Hal had a long walk, and he thought it most
prudent to get ready to start home. The lightning
glared in at the door and windows most vividly, and
the heavy thunder crashed and rumbled and roared
louder than he had ever heard it before. The rain,
too, now commenced to batter down tremendously, and
just as night set in, Hal had just got ready to set out.
Hal first felt uneasy, next unhappy, and finally miserable.
If he had but a boy to talk to! I'm afraid Hal
began to grow scared. A verse that he learned in his
boyhood, across the wide sea, came unasked into his
mind. It always came there precisely at the time he
did not desire its company. It ran thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! for the might of dread Odin<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The powers upon him shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a sail in the good ship Skidbladnir,<a name="FNanchor_A-236_4" id="FNanchor_A-236_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A-236_4" class="fnanchor">[A-236]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i1">And a talk with Mimir's head!"<a name="FNanchor_B-236_5" id="FNanchor_B-236_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_B-236_5" class="fnanchor">[B-236]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A-236_4" id="Footnote_A-236_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A-236_4"><span class="label">[A-236]</span></a> The ship Skidbladnir was the property of Odin. He could sail in
it on the most dangerous seas, and yet could fold it up and carry it in
his pocket.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B-236_5" id="Footnote_B-236_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B-236_5"><span class="label">[B-236]</span></a> Mimir's head was always the companion of Odin. When he desired
to know what was transpiring in distant countries, he inquired
of Mimir, and always received a correct reply.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This verse was repeated over and over again inaudibly.
Gradually, however, his voice became a little louder,
and a little louder still, until finally poor Hal hallooed
it vociferously forth so sonorously that it drowned the
very thunder. He had repeated it just seventy-seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
times, when suddenly a monstrous head was thrust in
at the door, and demanded, in a voice that sounded like
the maelstrom, "What do <i>you</i> want with Odin?" "Oh,
nothing&mdash;nothing in the world, I thank you, sir," politely
responded poor Hal, shaking from head to foot. Here
the head was followed by the shoulders, arms, body and
legs of a giant at least forty feet high. Of course he
came in on all fours, and approached in close proximity
to Black Hal. Hal involuntarily retreated, as far as he
could, reciting to himself the only prayer he remembered,
"Now I lay me down to sleep," etc.</p>

<p>The giant did not appear desirous of pursuing Hal,
being afraid&mdash;so Hal said&mdash;that he would draw his knife
on him. But be the cause what it might, he seated himself
at the head of the nine-pin alley, and shouted,
"Stand up!" As he did so, the nine-pins at the other
end arose and took their places.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said he, turning again to Hal, "I'll bet
you an ounce of your blood I can beat you rolling."</p>

<p>Hal trembled again, but meekly replied, "Please, sir,
we don't bet <i>blood</i> nowadays&mdash;we bet <i>money</i>."</p>

<p>"Blood's my money," roared forth the giant. "Fee,
fo, fum!" Hal tried in vain to hoist the window.</p>

<p>"Will you bet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Hal; and he thought as it was only
<i>an ounce</i>, he could spare that without much danger, and
it might appease the monster's appetite.</p>

<p>"Roll first!" said the giant.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Hal, as he seized what he supposed
to be the largest and his favorite ball.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with Mimir's head?" roared
forth the monster.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, most humbly," began Hal, as
he let the bloody head fall; "I did not mean any harm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>"Rumble, bang-whang!" bellowed the thunder.</p>

<p>Hal fell on his knees and recited most devoutly,
"Now I lay me down," etc.</p>

<p>"Roll on! roll on! I say," and the giant seized poor
Hal by the collar and set him on his feet.</p>

<p>He now selected a large ball, and poising it carefully
in his hand, ran a few steps, and sent it whirling right
in among the nine-pins; but what was his astonishment
to behold them jump lightly aside, and permit the ball
to pass in an avenue directly through the middle of the
alley. Hal shuddered. The second and third ball met
with no better success. Odin&mdash;for Hal said it was certainly
he, as he had Mimir's head along&mdash;now grasped
a ball and rolled it with all his might; but long before
it reached the nine-pins, they had, every one of them,
tumbled down, and lay sprawling on the alley.</p>

<p>"Two spares!" said the giant, as he grinned most
gleefully at poor Hal. "Get up!" and up the pins all
stood instantly. Taking another ball, he hurled it down
the alley, and the same result followed. "Two more
spares!" and Odin shook his gigantic sides with
laughter.</p>

<p>"I give up the game," whined out Hal.</p>

<p>"Then you lose double," rejoined Odin.</p>

<p>Hal readily consented to pay two ounces, for he
imagined, by yielding at once, he would so much the
sooner get rid of his grim companion. As he said so,
Odin pulled a pair of scales out of his coat pocket, made
proportionably to his own size. He poised them upon
a beam in the alley, and drew forth what he denominated
two ounces, and put them in one scale. Each ounce
was about the size of a twenty-eight pound weight, and
was quite as heavy.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!! Ha! ha! ha!!! Ha! ha! ha!!!!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
shouted the giant, as he grasped the gasping and terrified
gambler. He soon rolled up his sleeves, and bound
his arm with a pocket handkerchief. Next he drew
forth a lancet as long as a sword, and drove the point
into the biggest vein he could discover. Hal screamed
and fainted. When he returned to consciousness, the
sun was shining brightly in at the window, and the
sweet rumbling of the balls assured him that he still lay
where the giant left him. On rising to his feet he perceived
that a large coagulum of blood had collected
where his head rested all night, and that he could
scarcely walk from the effects of his exhaustion. He
returned immediately home and told his wife all that
had occurred; and though, like some of the neighbors,
she distrusted the tale, yet she never intimated her
doubts to Black Hal himself. The alley-keeper assured
me in a whisper, one day, that upon the very night fixed
on by Hal for the adventure, he was beastly drunk, and
had been engaged in a fight with one of his boon companions,
who gave him a black eye and a bloody nose.
But the alley-keeper was always jealous of Black Hal's
superiority in story telling; besides, he often drank too
much himself, and I suspect he originated the report he
related to me in a fit of wounded pride, or drunken
braggadocio. One thing is certain, he never ventured
to repeat the story in the presence of Black Hal himself.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In spite of the attention I endeavored to bestow on
the marvelous history of Black Hal and his grim companion,
my mind occasionally wandered far away, and
could only find repose in communing with her who I
now discovered for the first time held in her own hands
the thread of my destiny. Lucy was not blind to these
fits of abstraction, and whenever they gained entire
control of my attention, she would pause, lay down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
manuscript, and threaten most seriously to discontinue
the perusal, unless I proved a better listener. I ask no
man's pardon for declaring that my sister was an excellent
reader. Most brothers, perhaps think the same
of most sisters; but there <i>was</i> a charm in Lucy's accent
and a distinctness in her enunciation I have never
heard excelled. Owing to these qualities, as much,
perhaps, as to the strangeness of the story, I became
interested in the fate of the drunken gambler, and when
Lucy concluded, I was ready to exclaim, "And pray
where is Black Hal now?"</p>

<p>My thoughts took another direction, however, and I
impatiently demanded whether or not the sample story
had been imitated. A guilty blush assured me quite
as satisfactorily as words could have done, that Miss
Lucy had herself made an attempt, and I therefore
insisted that as she had whetted and excited the appetite,
it would be highly unfraternal&mdash;(particularly in my
present very precarious condition)&mdash;that parenthesis
settled the matter&mdash;to deny me the means of satisfying it.</p>

<p>"But you'll laugh at me," timidly whispered my
sister.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall," said I, "if your catastrophe is
half as melancholy as Black Hal's. But make haste,
or I shall be off to St. Louis. But pray inform me,
what is the subject of your composition?"</p>

<p>"The Origin of Marriage."</p>

<p>"I believe, on my soul," responded I, laughing outright,
"you girls never think about anything else."</p>

<p>I provoked no reply, and the manuscript being unfolded,
my sister thus attempted to elucidate</p>

<p class="secsc">THE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE.</p>

<p>Professor Williams having ceased his manipulations,
my eyes involuntarily closed, and I became unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
to everything occurring around me. There's truth in
mesmerism, after all, thought I, and being in the clairvoyant
state, I beheld a most beautiful comet at this
moment emerging from the constellation Taurus, and
describing a curve about the star Zeta, one of the
Pleiades. Now for a trip through infinite space! and
as this thought entered my brain, I grasped a hair in
the tail of the comet as it whizzed by me.</p>

<p>I climbed up the glittering hair until I found myself
seated very comfortably on the comet's back, and was
beginning to enjoy my starlit ramble exceedingly, when
I was suddenly aroused from my meditations by the
song of a heavenly minstrel, who, wandering from star
to star and system to system, sang the fate of other
worlds and other beings to those who would listen to
his strains and grant him the rites of hospitality. As
I approached, his tones were suddenly changed, his
voice lowered into a deeper key, and gazing intently at
me, or at what evidenced my presence to his sight, thus
began:</p>

<p>The flaming sword of the cherub, which had waved
so frightfully above the gate of the garden of Eden,
had disappeared; the angel himself was gone; and
Adam, as he approached the spot where so lately he
had enjoyed the delights of heaven, beheld with astonishment
and regret that Paradise and all its splendors
had departed from the earth forever. Where the garden
lately bloomed, he could discover only the dark
and smouldering embers of a conflagration; a hard lava
had incrusted itself along the golden walks; the birds
were flown, the flowers withered, the fountains dried
up, and desolation brooded over the scene.</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the patriarch of men, "where are now
the pleasures which I once enjoyed along these peaceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
avenues? Where are all those beautiful spirits,
given by Heaven to watch over and protect me? Each
guardian angel has deserted me, and the rainbow
glories of Paradise have flown. No more the sun shines
out in undimmed splendor, for clouds array him in
gloom; the earth, forgetful of her verdure and her
flowers, produces thorns to wound and frosts to chill
me. The very air, once all balm and zephyrs, now
howls around me with the voice of the storm and the
fury of the hurricane. No more the notes of peace
and happiness greet my ears, but the harsh tones of
strife and battle resound on every side. Nature has
kindled the flames of discord in her own bosom, and
universal war has begun his reign!"</p>

<p>And then the father of mankind hid his face in the
bosom of his companion, and wept the bitter tears of
contrition and repentance.</p>

<p>"Oh, do not weep so bitterly, my Adam," exclaimed
his companion. "True, we are miserable, but all is
not yet lost; we have forfeited the smiles of Heaven,
but we may yet regain our lost place in its affections.
Let us learn from our misfortunes the anguish of guilt,
but let us learn also the mercy of redemption. We
may yet be happy."</p>

<p>"Oh, talk not of happiness now," interrupted Adam;
"that nymph who once wailed at our side, attentive to
the beck, has disappeared, and fled from the companionship
of such guilty, fallen beings as ourselves,
forever."</p>

<p>"Not forever, Adam," kindly rejoined Eve; "she
may yet be lurking among these groves, or lie hid behind
yon hills."</p>

<p>"Then let us find her," quickly responded Adam;
"you follow the sun, sweet Eve, to his resting-place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
whilst I will trace these sparkling waters to their bourn.
Let us ramble this whole creation o'er; and when we
have found her, let us meet again on this very spot,
and cling to her side, until the doom of death shall
overtake us."</p>

<p>And the eye of Adam beamed with hope, then kindled
for the first time on earth in the bosom of man;
and he bade Eve his first farewell, and started eastward
in his search.</p>

<p>Eve turned her face to the west, and set out on her
allotted journey.</p>

<p>The sun had shone a hundred times in midsummer
splendor, and a hundred times had hid himself in the
clouds of winter, and yet no human foot had trod the
spot where the garden of Eden once bloomed. Adam
had in vain traced the Euphrates to the sea, and climbed
the Himalaya Mountains. In vain had he endured the
tropical heats on the Ganges, and the winter's cold in
Siberia. He stood at last upon the borders of that narrow
sea which separates Asia from America, and casting
a wistful glance to the far-off continent, exclaimed: "In
yon land, so deeply blue in the distance, that it looks
like heaven, Happiness may have taken refuge. Alas!
I cannot pursue her there. I will return to Eden, and
learn if Eve, too, has been unsuccessful."</p>

<p>And then he took one more look at the distant land,
sighed his adieu, and set out on his return.</p>

<p>Poor Eve! First child of misery, first daughter of
despair! Poor Eve, with the blue of heaven in her eye,
and the crimson of shame upon her lip! Poor Eve,
arrayed in beauty, but hastening to decay&mdash;she, too,
was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Wandering in her westward way, the azure waters of
the Mediterranean soon gleamed upon her sight. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
stood at length upon the pebbly shore, and the glad
waves, silent as death before, when they kissed her
naked feet, commenced that song still heard in their
eternal roar. A mermaid seemed to rise from the waters
at her feet, and to imitate her every motion. Her long
dark tresses, her deep blue eyes, her rosy cheek, her
sorrowful look, all were reflected in the mermaid before
her.</p>

<p>"Sweet spirit," said Eve, "canst thou inform me
where the nymph Happiness lies concealed? She always
stood beside us in the garden of Eden; but when we
were driven from Paradise we beheld her no more."</p>

<p>The lips of the mermaid moved, but Eve could hear
no reply.</p>

<p>Ah! mother of mankind, the crystal waters of every
sea, reflecting thy lovely image, still faithful to their
trust, conceal a mermaid in their bosom for every
daughter of beauty who looks upon them!</p>

<p>Neither the orange groves of the Arno, nor the vineyards
of France; neither the forests of Germania, nor
the caves of Norway, concealed the sought-for nymph.
Eve explored them all. Her track was imprinted in the
sands of Sahara, by the banks of the Niger, on the
rocks of Bengola, in the vales of Abyssinia&mdash;but all in
vain.</p>

<p>"O Happiness! art thou indeed departed from our
earth? How can we live without thee? Come, Death,"
cried Eve; "come now, and take me where thou wilt.
This world is a desert, for Happiness has left it
desolate."</p>

<p>A gentle slumber soon overcame the wearied child of
sorrow, and in her sleep a vision came to comfort her.
She dreamed that she stood before an aged man, whose
hoary locks attested that the snows of many winters had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
whitened them, and in whose glance she recognized the
spirit of Wisdom.</p>

<p>"Aged Father," said Eve, "where is Happiness?"
and then she burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"Comfort thyself, Daughter," mildly answered the
old man; "Happiness yet dwells on earth, but she is
no longer visible. A temple is built for her in every
mortal's bosom, but she never ascends her throne until
welcomed there by the child of Honor and Love."</p>

<p>The morning sun aroused Eve from her slumber, but
did not dispel the memory of her dream. "I will return
to Eden, and there await until the child of Honor
and Love shall enthrone in my bosom the lost nymph
Happiness;" and saying this, she turned her face to the
eastward, and thinking of Adam and her vision, journeyed
joyfully along.</p>

<p>The sun of Spring had opened the flowers and clothed
the woods in verdure; had freed the streams from their
icy fetters, and inspired the warbling world with harmony,
when two forlorn and weary travelers approached
the banks of the river Pison; that river which had
flowed through the garden of Eden when the first sunshine
broke upon the world. A hundred years had
rolled away, and the echo of no human voice had resounded
through the deserted groves. At length the
dusky figures emerged from the overshadowing shrubbery,
and raised their eyes into each other's faces. One
bound&mdash;one cry&mdash;and they weep for joy in each other's
arms.</p>

<p>Adam related his sad and melancholy story, and then
Eve soon finished hers. But no sooner had she told
her dream, than Adam, straining her to his bosom,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There is no mystery here, my Eve. If Happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
on earth be indeed the child of Honor and Love, it
must be in Matrimony alone. What else now left us
on earth can lay claim to the precious boon? Approved
by heaven, and cherished by man, in the holy bonds of
Matrimony it must consist; and if this be all, we need
seek no further; it is ours!"</p>

<p>They then knelt in prayer, and returned thanks to
Heaven, that though the garden of Eden was a wild,
and the nymph Happiness no longer an angel at their
side, yet that her spirit was still present in every
bosom where the heart is linked to Honor and Love
by the sacred ties of Matrimony.</p>

<h2>XX.</h2>

<h3><i>THE TWO GEORGES.</i></h3>


<p class="cap">Between the years of our Lord 1730 and 1740,
two men were born on opposite sides of the Atlantic
Ocean, whose lives were destined to exert a commanding
influence on the age in which they lived, as
well as to control the fortunes of many succeeding generations.</p>

<p>One was by birth a plain peasant, the son of a Virginia
farmer; the other an hereditary Prince, and the
heir of an immense empire. It will be the main object
of this sketch to trace the histories of these two individuals,
so dissimilar in their origin, from birth to
death, and show how it happened that one has left a
name synonymous with tyranny, whilst the other will
descend to the lowest posterity, radiant with immortal
glory, and renowned the world over as the friend of
virtue, the guardian of liberty, and the benefactor of his
race.</p>

<p>Go with me for one moment to the crowded and
splendid metropolis of England. It is the evening of
the 4th of June 1734. Some joyful event must have
occurred, for the bells are ringing merrily, and the inhabitants
are dressed in holiday attire. Nor is the circumstance
of a private nature, for banners are everywhere
displayed, the vast city is illuminated, and a
thousand cannon are proclaiming it from their iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
throats. The population seem frantic with joy, and
rush tumultuously into each other's arms, in token of a
national jubilee. Tens of thousands are hurrying along
toward a splendid marble pile, situated on a commanding
eminence, near the river Thames, whilst from the
loftiest towers of St. James's Palace the national ensigns
of St. George and the Red Cross are seen floating on
the breeze. Within one of the most gorgeously furnished
apartments of that royal abode, the wife of
Frederic, Prince of Wales, and heir apparent to the
British Empire, has just been delivered of a son. The
scions of royalty crowd into the bed-chamber, and
solemnly attest the event as one on which the destiny of
a great empire is suspended. The corridors are thronged
with dukes, and nobles, and soldiers, and courtiers, all
anxious to bend the supple knee, and bow the willing
neck, to power just cradled into the world. A Royal
Proclamation soon follows, commemorating the event,
and commanding British subjects everywhere, who
acknowledge the honor of Brunswick, to rejoice, and
give thanks to God for safely ushering into existence
George William Frederic, heir presumptive of the united
crowns of Great Britain and Ireland. Just twenty-two
years afterward that child ascended the throne of his
ancestors as King George the Third.</p>

<p>Let us now turn our eyes to the Western Continent,
and contemplate a scene of similar import, but under
circumstances of a totally different character. It is the
22d February, 1732. The locality is a distant colony,
the spot the verge of an immense, untrodden and unexplored
wilderness, the habitation a log cabin, with its
chinks filled in with clay, and its sloping roof patched
over with clapboards. Snow covers the ground, and a
chill wintery wind is drifting the flakes, and moaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
through the forest. Two immense chimneys stand at
either end of the house, and give promise of cheerful
comfort and primitive hospitality within, totally in contrast
with external nature. There are but four small
rooms in the dwelling, in one of which Mary Ball, the
wife of Augustine Washington, has just given birth to
a son. No dukes or marquises or earls are there to
attest the humble event. There are no princes of the
blood to wrap the infant in the insignia of royalty, and
fold about his limbs the tapestried escutcheon of a
kingdom. His first breath is not drawn in the center
of a mighty capitol, the air laden with perfume, and
trembling to the tones of soft music and the "murmurs
of low fountains." But the child is received from its
Mother's womb by hands imbrowned with honest labor,
and laid upon a lowly couch, indicative only of a backwoodsman's
home and an American's inheritance. He,
too, is christened George, and forty-three years afterward
took command of the American forces assembled
on the plains of old Cambridge.</p>

<p>But if their births were dissimilar, their rearing and
education were still more unlike. From his earliest
recollection the Prince heard only the language of flattery,
moved about from palace to palace, just as caprice
dictated, slept upon the cygnet's down, and grew up in
indolence, self-will and vanity, a dictator from his cradle.
The peasant boy, on the other hand, was taught from
his infancy that labor was honorable, and hardships indispensable
to vigorous health. He early learned to
sleep alone amid the dangers of a boundless wilderness,
a stone for his pillow, and the naked sod his bed;
whilst the voices of untamed nature around him sang
his morning and his evening hymns. Truth, courage
and constancy were early implanted in his mind by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
mother's counsels, and the important lesson of life was
taught by a father's example, that when existence ceases
to be useful it ceases to be happy.</p>

<p>Early manhood ushered them both into active life;
the one as king over extensive dominions, the other as
a modest, careful, and honest district surveyor.</p>

<p>Having traced the two Georges to the threshold of
their career, let us now proceed one step further, and
take note of the first great public event in the lives of
either.</p>

<p>For a long time preceding the year 1753 the French
had laid claim to all the North American continent
west of the Alleghany Mountains, stretching in an unbroken
line from Canada to Louisiana. The English
strenuously denied this right, and when the French
commandant on the Ohio, in 1753, commenced erecting
a fort near where the present city of Pittsburg stands,
and proceeded to capture certain English traders, and
expel them from the country, Dinwiddie, Governor of
Virginia, deemed it necessary to dispatch an agent on a
diplomatic visit to the French commandant, and demand
by what authority he acted, by what title he claimed
the country, and order him immediately to evacuate the
territory.</p>

<p>George Washington, then only in his twenty-second
year, was selected by the Governor for this important
mission.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow him, in all his perils, during
his wintery march through the wilderness. The
historian of his life has painted in imperishable colors
his courage, his sagacity, his wonderful coolness in the
midst of danger, and the success which crowned his
undertaking. The memory loves to follow him through
the trackless wilds of the forest, accompanied by only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
a single companion, and making his way through wintery
snows, in the midst of hostile savages and wild beasts
for more than five hundred miles, to the residence of
the French commander. How often do we not shudder,
as we behold the treacherous Indian guide, on his
return, deliberately raising his rifle, and leveling it at
that majestic form; thus endeavoring, by an act of
treachery and cowardice, to deprive Virginia of her
young hero! And oh! with what fervent prayers do
we not implore a kind Providence to watch over his
desperate encounter with the floating ice, at midnight,
in the swollen torrent of the Alleghany, and rescue him
from the wave and the storm. Standing bareheaded on
the frail raft, whilst in the act of dashing aside some
floating ice that threatened to ingulf him, the treacherous
oar was broken in his hand, and he is precipitated
many feet into the boiling current. Save! oh, save
him heaven! for the destinies of millions yet unborn
hang upon that noble arm!</p>

<p>Let us now recross the ocean. In the early part of
the year 1764 a ministerial crisis occurs in England,
and Lord Bute, the favorite of the British monarch, is
driven from the administration of the government. The
troubles with the American colonists have also just commenced
to excite attention, and the young King grows
angry, perplexed, and greatly irritated. A few days
after this, a rumor starts into circulation that the monarch
is sick. His attendants look gloomy, his friends
terrified, and even his physicians exhibit symptoms of
doubt and danger. Yet he has no fever, and is daily
observed walking with uncertain and agitated step along
the corridors of the palace. His conduct becomes
gradually more and more strange, until doubt gives
place to certainty, and the royal medical staff report to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
a select committee of the House of Commons that the
King is threatened with <i>insanity</i>. For six weeks the
cloud obscures his mental faculties, depriving him of
all interference with the administration of the government,
and betokening a sad disaster in the future. His
reason is finally restored, but frequent fits of passion,
pride and obstinacy indicate but too surely that the
disease is seated, and a radical cure impossible.</p>

<p>Possessed now of the chief characteristics of George
Washington and George Guelph, we are prepared to
review briefly their conduct during the struggle that
ensued between the two countries they respectively
represented.</p>

<p>Let us now refer to the first act of disloyalty of
Washington, the first indignant spurn his high-toned
spirit evinced under the oppressions of a king.</p>

<p>Not long after his return from the west, Washington
was offered the chief command of the forces about to
be raised in Virginia, to expel the French; but, with
his usual modesty, he declined the appointment, on
account of his extreme youth, but consented to take
the post of lieutenant-colonel. Shortly afterward, on
the death of Colonel Fry, he was promoted to the chief
command, but through no solicitations of his own.
Subsequently, when the war between France and England
broke out in Europe, the principal seat of hostilities
was transferred to America, and his Gracious
Majesty George III sent over a large body of troops,
<i>under the command of favorite officers</i>. But this was not
enough. An edict soon followed, denominated an "Order
to settle the rank of the officers of His Majesty's
forces serving in America." By one of the articles of
this order, it was provided "that all officers commissioned
by the King, should take precedence of those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the same grade commissioned by the governors of the
respective colonies, although their commissions might
be of junior date;" and it was further provided, that
"when the troops served together, the provincial officers
should enjoy no rank at all." This order was
scarcely promulgated&mdash;indeed, before the ink was dry&mdash;ere
the Governor of Virginia received a communication
informing him that <i>George Washington was no longer
a soldier</i>. Entreaties, exhortations, and threats were
all lavished upon him in vain; and to those who, in
their expostulations, spoke of the defenseless frontiers
of his native State, he patriotically but nobly replied:
"I will serve my country when I can do so without
dishonor."</p>

<p>In contrast with this attitude of Washington, look at
the conduct of George the Third respecting the colonies,
after the passage of the Stamp Act. This act was
no sooner proclaimed in America, than the most violent
opposition was manifested, and combinations for the
purpose of effectual resistance were rapidly organized
from Massachusetts to Georgia. The leading English
patriots, among whom were Burke and Barr, protested
against the folly of forcing the colonies into rebellion,
and the city of London presented a petition to the King,
praying him to dismiss the Granville ministry, and repeal
the obnoxious act. "It is with the utmost astonishment,"
replied the King, "that I find any of my subjects
capable of encouraging the rebellious disposition
that unhappily exists in some of my North American
colonies. Having entire confidence in the wisdom of
my parliament, the great council of the realm, I will
steadily pursue those measures which they have recommended
for the support of the constitutional rights of
Great Britain." He heeded not the memorable words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of Burke, that afterward became prophetic. "There
are moments," exclaimed this great statesman, "critical
moments in the fortunes of all states when they who
are too weak to contribute to your prosperity may yet
be strong enough to complete your ruin." The Boston
port bill passed, and the first blood was spilt at Lexington.</p>

<p>It is enough to say of the long and bloody war that
followed, that George the Third, by his obstinacy, contributed
more than any other man in his dominion to
prolong the struggle, and affix to it the stigma of cruelty,
inhumanity and vengeance; whilst Washington was
equally the soul of the conflict on the other side, and by
his imperturbable justice, moderation and firmness, did
more than by his arms to convince England that her
revolted colonists were invincible.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to review in detail the old Revolution.
Let us pass to the social position of the two
Georges in after-life.</p>

<p>On the 2d August, 1786, as the King was alighting
from his carriage at the gate of St. James, an attempt
was made on his life by a woman named Margaret
Nicholson, who, under pretense of presenting a petition,
endeavored to stab him with a knife which was concealed
in the paper. The weapon was an old one, and
so rusty that, on striking the vest of the King, it bent
double, and thus preserved his life. On the 29th October,
1795, whilst his majesty was proceeding to the
House of Lords, a ball passed through both windows of
the carriage. On his return to St. James the mob
threw stones into the carriage, several of which struck
the King, and one lodged in the cuff of his coat. The
state carriage was completely demolished by the mob.
But it was on the 15th May, 1800, that George the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Third made his narrowest escapes. In the morning of
that day, whilst attending the field exercise of a battalion
of guards, one of the soldiers loaded his piece
with a bullet and discharged it at the King. The ball
fortunately missed its aim, and lodged in the thigh of a
gentleman who was standing in the rear. In the evening
of the same day a more alarming circumstance occurred
at the Drury Lane Theatre. At the moment when
the King entered the royal box, a man in the pit, on the
right-hand side of the orchestra, suddenly stood up and
discharged a large horse-pistol at him. The hand of
the would-be assassin was thrown up by a bystander,
and the ball entered the box just above the head of the
King.</p>

<p>Such were the public manifestations of affection for
this royal tyrant. He was finally attacked by an enemy
that could not be thwarted, and on the 20th December,
1810, he became a confirmed lunatic. In this dreadful
condition he lingered until January, 1820, when he
died, having been the most unpopular, unwise and
obstinate sovereign that ever disgraced the English
throne. He was forgotten as soon as life left his body,
and was hurriedly buried with that empty pomp which
but too often attends a despot to the grave.</p>

<p>His whole career is well summed up by Allan Cunningham,
his biographer, in few words: "Throughout
his life he manifested a strong disposition to be his
own minister, and occasionally placed the kingly prerogatives
in perilous opposition to the resolutions of
the nation's representatives. His interference with the
deliberations of the upper house, as in the case of
Fox's Indian bill, was equally ill-judged and dangerous.
<i>The separation of America from the mother country, at the
time it took place, was the result of the King's personal feelings
and interference with the ministry.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> The war with
France was, in part at least, attributable to the views
and wishes of the sovereign of England. His obstinate
refusal to grant any concessions to his Catholic subjects,
kept his cabinet perpetually hanging on the brink
of dissolution, and threatened the dismemberment of the
kingdom. He has been often praised for firmness, but
it was in too many instances the firmness of obstinacy;
a dogged adherence to an opinion once pronounced, or
a resolution once formed."</p>

<p>The mind, in passing from the unhonored grave of the
prince to the last resting-place of the peasant boy, leaps
from a kingdom of darkness to one of light.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the career of Washington.
Throughout the Revolutionary War he carried, like
Atropos, in his hand the destinies of millions; he bore,
like Atlas, on his shoulders the weight of a world. It
is unnecessary to follow him throughout his subsequent
career. Honored again and again by the people of the
land he had redeemed from thraldom, he has taken his
place in death by the side of the wisest and best of the
world's benefactors. Assassins did not unglory him in
life, nor has oblivion drawn her mantle over him in
death. The names of his great battle-fields have become
nursery words, and his principles have imbedded themselves
forever in the national character. Every pulsation
of our hearts beats true to his memory. His
mementoes are everywhere around and about us. Distant
as we are from the green fields of his native
Westmoreland, the circle of his renown has spread far
beyond our borders. In climes where the torch of
science was never kindled; on shores still buried in
primeval bloom; amongst barbarians where the face of
liberty was never seen, the Christian missionary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
America, roused perhaps from his holy duties by the
distant echo of the national salute, this day thundering
amidst the billows of every sea, or dazzled by the gleam
of his country's banner, this day floating in every wind
of heaven, pauses over his task as a Christian, and
whilst memory kindles in his bosom the fires of patriotism,
pronounced in the ear of the enslaved pagan the
venerated name of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>!</p>

<p>Nor are the sons of the companions of Washington
alone in doing justice to his memory. Our sisters,
wives and mothers compete with us in discharging this
debt of national gratitude. With a delicacy that none
but woman could exhibit, and with a devotion that none
but a daughter could feel, they are now busy in executing
the noble scheme of purchasing his tomb, in order
for endless generations to stand sentinel over his remains.
Take them! take them to your hearts, oh! ye
daughters of America; enfold them closer to your bosom
than your first-born offspring; build around them a
mausoleum that neither time nor change can overthrow;
for within them germinates the seeds of liberty for the
benefit of millions yet unborn. Wherever tyranny shall
lift its Medusan head, wherever treason shall plot its
hellish schemes, wherever disunion shall unfurl its
tattered ensign, there, oh there, sow them in the hearts
of patriots and republicans! For from these pale ashes
there shall spring, as from the dragon's teeth sown by
Cadmus of old on the plains of Heber, vast armies of
invincible heroes, sworn upon the altar and tomb at
Mount Vernon, to live as freemen, or as such to die!</p>

<h2>XXIII.</h2>

<h3><i>SCIENCE, LITERATURE AND ART DURING THE
FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</i></h3>


<p class="cap">Looking back into the past, and exploring by the
light of authentic history, sacred as well as profane,
the characteristics of former ages, the merest
tyro in learning cannot fail to perceive that certain
epochs stand prominently out on the "sands of time,"
and indicate vast activity and uncommon power in the
human mind.</p>

<p>These epochs are so well marked that history has
given them a designation, and to call them by their
name, conjures up, as by the wand of an enchanter, the
heroic representatives of our race.</p>

<p>If, for instance, we should speak of the era of Solomon,
in sacred history, the memory would instantly
picture forth the pinnacles of the Holy Temple, lifting
themselves into the clouds; the ear would listen intently
to catch the sweet intonations of the harp of David,
vocal at once with the prophetic sorrows of his race, and
swelling into sublime ecstasy at the final redemption of
his people; the eye would glisten at the pomp and
pageantry of the foreign potentates who thronged his
court, and gloat with rapture over the beauty of the
young Queen of Sheba, who journeyed from a distant
land to seek wisdom at the feet of the wisest monarch
that ever sat upon a throne. We should behold his
ships traversing every sea, and pouring into the lap of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Israel the gold of Ophir, the ivory of Senegambia, and
the silks, myrrh, and spices of the East.</p>

<p>So, too, has profane history its golden ages, when
men all seemed to be giants, and their minds inspired.</p>

<p>What is meant when we speak of the age of Pericles?
We mean all that is glorious in the annals of Greece.
We mean Apelles with his pencil, Phidias with his
chisel, Alcibiades with his sword. We seem to be
strolling arm-in-arm with Plato, into the academy, to
listen to the divine teachings of Socrates, or hurrying
along with the crowd toward the theatre, where Herodotus
is reading his history, or Euripides is presenting
his tragedies. Aspasia rises up like a beautiful apparition
before us, and we follow willing slaves at the
wheels of her victorious chariot. The whole of the
Peloponnesus glows with intellect like a forge in blast,
and scatters the trophies of Grecian civilization profusely
around us. The Parthenon lifts its everlasting
columns, and the Venus and Apollo are moulded into
marble immortality.</p>

<p>Rome had her Augustan age, an era of poets, philosophers,
soldiers, statesmen, and orators. Crowded into
contemporary life, we recognize the greatest general of
the heathen world, the greatest poet, the greatest orator,
and the greatest statesman of Rome. Csar and Cicero,
Virgil and Octavius, all trod the pavement of the capitol
together, and lent their blended glory to immortalize
the Augustan age.</p>

<p>Italy and Spain and France and England have had
their golden age. The eras of Lorenzo the Magnificent,
of Ferdinand and Isabella, of Louis Quatorze and of
Elizabeth, can never be forgotten. They loom up from
the surrounding gloom like the full moon bursting upon
the sleeping seas; irradiating the night, clothing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
meanest wave in sparkling silver, and dimming the lustre
of the brightest stars. History has also left in its
track mementoes of a different character. In sacred
history we have the age of Herod; in profane, the age
of Nero. We recognize at a glance the talismanic touch
of the age of chivalry, and the era of the Crusades, and
mope our way in darkness and gloom along that opaque
track, stretching from the reign of Justinian, in the
sixth century, to the reign of Edward the Third, in the
fourteenth, and known throughout Christendom as the
"Dark Ages." Let us now take a survey of the field
we occupy, and ascertain, if possible, the category in
which our age shall be ranked by our posterity.</p>

<p>But before proceeding to discuss the characteristics
of our epoch, let us define more especially what that
epoch embraces.</p>

<p>It does not embrace the American nor the French
Revolution, nor does it include the acts or heroes of
either. The impetus given to the human mind by the
last half of the eighteenth century, must be carefully
distinguished from the impulses of the first half of the
nineteenth. The first was an era of almost universal
war, the last of almost uninterrupted peace. The dying
ground-swell of the waves after a storm belong to the
tempest, not to the calm which succeeds. Hence the
wars of Napoleon, the literature and art of his epoch,
must be excluded from observation, in properly discussing
the true characteristics of our era.</p>

<p>De Stal and Goethe and Schiller and Byron; Pitt
and Nesselrode, Metternich and Hamilton; Fichte and
Stewart and Brown and Cousin; Canova, Thorwaldsen
and La Place, though all dying since the beginning of
this century, belong essentially to a former era. They
were the ripened fruits of that grand uprising of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
human mind which first took form on the 4th day of
July, 1776. Our era properly commences with the
downfall of the first Napoleon, and none of the events
connected therewith, either before or afterward, can
be philosophically classed in the epoch we represent,
but must be referred to a former period. Ages hence,
then, the philosophic critic will thus describe the first
half of the nineteenth century:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The normal state of Christendom was peace. The
age of steel that immediately went before it had passed.
It was the Iron age.</p>

<p>"Speculative philosophy fell asleep; literature declined;
Skepticism bore sway in religion, politics, and
morals; Utility became the universal standard of right
and wrong, and the truths of every science and the
axioms of every art were ruthlessly subjected to the
<i>experimentum crucis</i>. Everything was liable to revision.
The verdicts pronounced in the olden time against Mohammed
and Mesmer and Robespierre were set aside,
and a new trial granted. The ghosts of Roger Bacon
and Emanuel Swedenborg were summoned from the
Stygian shore to plead their causes anew before the bar
of public opinion. The head of Oliver Cromwell was
ordered down from the gibbet, the hump was smoothed
down on the back of Richard III, and the sentence pronounced
by Urban VIII against the 'starry Galileo'
reversed forever. Aristotle was decently interred beneath
a modern monument inscribed thus: '<i>In pace
requiescat;</i>' whilst Francis Bacon was rescued from the
sacrilegious hands of kings and peers and parliament,
and canonized by the unanimous consent of Christendom.
It was the age of tests. Experiment governed
the world. Germany led the van, and Humboldt became
the impersonation of his times."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>Such unquestionably will be the verdict of the future,
when the present time, with all its treasures and trash,
its hopes and realizations, shall have been safely shelved
and labeled amongst the musty records of bygone generations.</p>

<p>Let us now examine into the grounds of this verdict
more minutely, and test its accuracy by exemplifications.</p>

<p>I. And first, who believes now in <i>innate ideas?</i> Locke
has been completely superseded by the materialists of
Germany and France, and all speculative moral philosophy
exploded. The audiences of Edinburgh and
Brown University interrupt Sir William Hamilton and
Dr. Wayland in their discourses, and, stripping off the
plumage from their theses, inquisitively demand, "<i>Cui
bono?</i>" What is the use of all this? How can we apply
it to the every-day concerns of life? We ask you for
bread and you have given us a stone; and though that
stone be a diamond, it is valueless, except for its glitter.
No philosopher can speculate successfully or even satisfactorily
to himself, when he is met at every turn by
some vulgar intruder into the domains of Aristotle and
Kant, who clips his wings just as he was prepared to
soar into the heavens, by an offer of copartnership to
"speculate," it may be, in the price of pork. Hence,
no moral philosopher of our day has been enabled to
erect any theory which will stand the assaults of logic
for a moment. Each school rises for an instant to the
surface, and sports out its little day in toss and tribulation,
until the next wave rolls along, with foam on
its crest and fury in its roar, and overwhelms it forever.
As with its predecessor, so with itself.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">"The eternal surge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Time and Tide rolls on and bears afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bubbles: as the old burst, new emerge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lashed from the foam of ages."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>II. But I have stated that this is an age of <i>literary
decline</i>. It is true that more books are written and
published, more newspapers and periodicals printed
and circulated, more extensive libraries collected and
incorporated, and more ink indiscriminately spilt, than
at any former period of the world's history. In looking
about us we are forcibly reminded of the sarcastic
couplet of Pope, who complains&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That those who cannot write, and those who can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0h">All scratch, all scrawl, and scribble to a man."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Had a modern gentleman all the eyes of Argus, all the
hands of Briareus, all the wealth of Cr&oelig;sus, and lived
to the age of Methuselah, his eyes would all fail, his
fingers all tire, his money all give out, and his years
come to an end, long before he perused one tenth of
the annual product of the press of Christendom at the
present day. It is no figure of rhetoric to say that the
press groans beneath the burden of its labors. Could
the types of Leipsic and London, Paris and New York,
speak out, the Litany would have to be amended, and
a new article added, to which they would solemnly
respond: "Spare us, good Lord!"</p>

<p>A recent publication furnishes the following statistical
facts relating to the book trade in our own
country: "Books have multiplied to such an extent
in the United States that it now takes 750 paper-mills,
with 2000 engines in constant operation, to supply the
printers, who work day and night, endeavoring to keep
their engagements with publishers. These tireless
mills produce 270,000,000 pounds of paper every year.
It requires a pound and a quarter of old rags for one
pound of paper, thus 340,000,000 pounds of rags were
consumed in this way last year. There are about 300
publishers in the United States, and near 10,000 book-sellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
who are engaged in the task of dispensing
literary pabulum to the public."</p>

<p>It may appear somewhat paradoxical to assert that
literature is declining whilst books and authors are
multiplying to such a fearful extent. Byron wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;<br /></span>
<span class="i0h">A book's a book, although there's nothing in 't."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>True enough; but books are not always literature.
A man may become an author without ceasing to be
an ignoramus. His name may adorn a title-page without
being recorded <i>in re perenne</i>. He may attempt
to write himself up a very "lion" in literature, whilst
good master Slender may be busily engaged "in writing
him down an ass."</p>

<p>Not one book in a thousand is a success; not one
success in ten thousand wreathes the fortunate author
with the laurel crown, and lifts him up into the region
of the immortals. Tell me, ye who prate about the
<i>literary glory</i> of the nineteenth century, wherein it
consists? Whose are</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The great, the immortal names<br /></span>
<span class="i0h">That were not born to die?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I cast my eyes up the long vista toward the Temple
of Fame, and I behold hundreds of thousands pressing
on to reach the shining portals. They jostle each other
by the way, they trip, they fall, they are overthrown
and ruthlessly trampled into oblivion, by the giddy
throng, as they rush onward and upward. One, it
may be two, of the million who started out, stand
trembling at the threshold, and with exultant voices cry
aloud for admittance. One perishes before the summons
can be answered; and the other, awed into immortality
by the august presence into which he enters,
is transformed into imperishable stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>Let us carefully scan the rolls of the literature of our
era, and select, if we can, poet, orator, or philosopher,
whose fame will deepen as it runs, and brighten as it
burns, until future generations shall drink at the fountain
and be refreshed, and kindle their souls at the
vestal flame and be purified, illuminated and ennobled.</p>

<p>In poetry, aye, in the crowded realms of song, who
bears the sceptre?&mdash;who wears the crown? America,
England, France and Germany can boast of bards <i>by
the gross</i>, and rhyme <i>by the acre</i>, but not a single poet.
The <i>poeta nascitur</i> is not here. He may be on his way&mdash;and
I have heard that he was&mdash;but this generation
must pass before he arrives. Is he in America? If
so, which is he? Is it Poe, croaking sorrowfully with
his "Raven," or Willis, cooing sweetly with his
"Dove"? Is it Bryant, with his "Thanatopsis," or
Prentice, with his "Dirge to the Dead Year"? Perhaps
it is Holmes, with his "Lyrics," or Longfellow,
with his "Idyls." Alas! is it not self-evident that we
have no poet, when it is utterly impossible to discover
any two critics in the land who can find him?</p>

<p>True, we have lightning-bugs enough, but no star;
foot-hills, it may be, in abundance, but no Mount
Shasta, with its base built upon the everlasting granite,
and its brow bathed in the eternal sunlight.</p>

<p>In England, Tennyson, the Laureate, is the spokesman
of a clique, the pet poet of a princely circle, whose
rhymes flow with the docility and harmony of a limpid
brook, but never stun like Niagara, nor rise into sublimity
like the storm-swept sea.</p>

<p>Branger, the greatest poet of France of our era, was
a mere song-writer; and Heine, the pride of young Germany,
a mere satirist and lyrist. Freiligrath can never
rank with Goethe or Schiller; and Victor Hugo never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
attain the heights trodden by Racine, Corneille, or
Boileau.</p>

<p>In oratory, where shall we find the compeer of Chatham
or Mirabeau, Burke or Patrick Henry? I have
not forgotten Peel and Gladstone, nor Lamartine and
Count Cavour, nor Sargent S. Prentiss and Daniel
Webster. But Webster himself, by far the greatest
intellect of all these, was a mere debater, and the
spokesman of a party. He was an eloquent speaker,
but can never rank as an orator with the rhetoricians of
the last century.</p>

<p>And in philosophy and general learning, where shall
we find the equal of that burly old bully, Dr. Sam
Johnson? and yet Johnson, with all his learning, was
a third-rate philosopher.</p>

<p>In truth, the greatest author of our era was a mere
essayist. Beyond all controversy, Thomas Babington
Macaulay was the most polished writer of our times.
With an intellect acute, logical and analytic; with an
imagination glowing and rich, but subdued and under
perfect control; with a style so clear and limpid and
concise, that it has become a standard for all who aim
to follow in the path he trod, and with a learning so full
and exact, and exhaustive, that he was nicknamed, when
an undergraduate, the "Omniscient Macaulay;" he still
lacks the giant grasp of thought, the bold originality,
and the intense, earnest enthusiasm which characterize
the master-spirits of the race, and identify them with
the eras they adorn.</p>

<p>III. As in literature, so in what have been denominated
by scholars the <i>Fine Arts</i>. The past fifty years
has not produced a painter, sculptor, or composer, who
ranks above mediocrity in their respective vocations.
Canova and Thorwaldsen were the last of their race;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Sir Joshua Reynolds left no successor, and the immortal
Beethoven has been superseded by negro minstrelsy
and senseless pantomime. The greatest architect of
the age is a railroad contractor, and the first dramatist
a cobbler of French farces.</p>

<p>IV. But whilst the highest faculty of the mind&mdash;the
imagination&mdash;has been left uncultivated, and has produced
no worthy fruit, the next highest, the casual, or
the one that deals with causes and effects, has been
stimulated into the most astonishing fertility.</p>

<p>Our age ignores fancy, and deals exclusively with
fact. Within its chosen range it stands far, very far
pre-eminent over all that have preceded it. It reaps
the fruit of Bacon's labors. It utilizes all that it touches.
It stands thoughtfully on the field of Waterloo, and
estimates scientifically the manuring properties of bones
and blood. It disentombs the mummy of Thotmes II,
sells the linen bandages for the manufacture of paper,
burns the asphaltum-soaked body for firewood, and
plants the pint of red wheat found in his sarcophagus,
to try an agricultural experiment. It deals in no sentimentalities;
it has no appreciation of the sublime.
It stands upon the ocean shore, but with its eyes fixed
on the yellow sand searching for gold. It confronts
Niagara, and, gazing with rapture at its misty shroud,
exclaims, in an ecstasy of admiration, "Lord, what a
place to sponge a coat!" Having no soul to save, it
has no religion to save it. It has discovered that
Mohammed was a great benefactor of his race, and that
Jesus Christ was, after all, a mere man; distinguished,
it is true, for his benevolence, his fortitude and his
morality, but for nothing else. It does not believe in
the Pope, nor in the Church, nor in the Bible. It ridicules
the infallibility of the first, the despotism of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
second, and the chronology of the third. It is possessed
of the very spirit of Thomas; it must "touch and handle"
before it will believe. It questions the existence of
spirit, because it cannot be analyzed by chemical solvents;
it questions the existence of hell, because it has
never been scorched; it questions the existence of God,
because it has never beheld Him.</p>

<p>It does, however, believe in the explosive force of
gunpowder, in the evaporation of boiling water, in the
head of the magnet, and in the heels of the lightnings.
It conjugates the Latin verb <i>invenio</i> (to find out)
through all its voices, moods and tenses. It invents
everything; from a lucifer match in the morning to
kindle a kitchen fire, up through all the intermediate
ranks and tiers and grades of life, to a telescope that
spans the heavens in the evening, it recognizes no chasm
or hiatus in its inventions. It sinks an artesian well in
the desert of Sahara for a pitcher of water, and bores
through the Alleghanies for a hogshead of oil. From a
fish-hook to the Great Eastern, from a pocket deringer
to a columbiad, from a sewing machine to a Victoria
suspension bridge, it oscillates like a pendulum.</p>

<p>Deficient in literature and art, our age surpasses all
others in science. Knowledge has become the great
end and aim of human life. "I want to know," is inscribed
as legibly on the hammer of the geologist, the
crucible of the chemist, and the equatorial of the astronomer,
as it is upon the phiz of a regular "Down-Easter."
Our age has inherited the chief failing of our first
mother, and passing by the "Tree of Life in the midst
of the Garden," we are all busily engaged in mercilessly
plundering the Tree of Knowledge of all its fruit. The
time is rapidly approaching when no man will be considered
a gentleman who has not filed his <i>caveat</i> in the
Patent Office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>The inevitable result of this spirit of the age begins
already to be seen. The philosophy of a cold, blank,
calculating materialism has taken possession of all the
avenues of learning. Epicurus is worshiped instead of
Christ. Mammon is considered as the only true savior.
<i>Dum Vivimus Vivamus</i>, is the maxim we live by, and
the creed we die by. We are all iconoclasts. St. Paul
has been superseded by St. Fulton; St John by St.
Colt; St. James by St. Morse; St. Mark by St. Manry;
and St. Peter has surrendered his keys to that great
incarnate representative of this age, St. Alexandre Von
Humboldt.</p>

<h2>XXVI.</h2>

<h3><i>THE SUMMERFIELD CASE.</i></h3>


<p class="cap">The following additional particulars, as sequel to
the Summerfield homicide, have been furnished by
an Auburn correspondent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>M<span class="smsmcap">r.</span> E<span class="smsmcap">ditor</span>: The remarkable confession of the late
Leonidas Parker, which appeared in your issue of the
13th ultimo, has given rise to a series of disturbances
in this neighborhood, which, for romantic interest and
downright depravity, have seldom been surpassed, even
in California. Before proceeding to relate in detail the
late transactions, allow me to remark that the wonderful
narrative of Parker excited throughout this county sentiments
of the most profound and contradictory character.
I, for one, halted between two opinions&mdash;horror
and incredulity; and nothing but subsequent events
could have fully satisfied me of the unquestionable
veracity of your San Francisco correspondent, and the
scientific authenticity of the facts related.</p>

<p>The doubt with which the story was at first received
in this community&mdash;and which found utterance in a burlesque
article in an obscure country journal, the Stars
and Stripes, of Auburn&mdash;has finally been dispelled and
we find ourselves forced to admit that we stand even
now in the presence of the most alarming fate. Too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
much credit cannot be awarded to our worthy coroner
for the promptitude of his action, and we trust that the
Governor of the State will not be less efficient in the
discharge of his duty.</p>

<p>[Since the above letter was written the following proclamation
has been issued.&mdash;P. J.]</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="secsc">PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNOR.</p>

<p class="titlesc">$10,000 REWARD!</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smsmcap">Department of State.</span></p>

<p>By virtue of the authority in me vested, I do hereby offer
the above reward of ten thousand dollars, in gold coin of
the United States, for the Arrest of Bartholomew Graham,
familiarly known as Black Bart. Said Graham is accused
of the murder of C. P. Gillson, late of Auburn, county of
Placer, on the 14th ultimo. He is five feet ten inches and
a half in height, thick set, has a mustache sprinkled with
gray, grizzled hair, clear blue eyes, walks stooping, and
served in the late civil war under Price and Quantrell, in
the Confederate army. He may be lurking in some of the
mining-camps near the foot-hills, as he was a Washoe
teamster during the Comstock excitement. The above
reward will be paid for him, <i>dead or alive</i>, as he possessed
himself of an important secret by robbing the body of the
late Gregory Summerfield.</p>

<p>By the Governor:</p>
<p class="sig"><span style="padding-right: 2.5em;">H. G. N<span class="smsmcap">icholson</span>,</span><br />
Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Given at Sacramento, this the fifth day of June, 1871.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Our correspondent continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I am sorry to say that Sheriff Higgins has not been
so active in the discharge of his duty as the urgency of
the case required, but he is perhaps excusable on account
of the criminal interference of the editor above
alluded to. But I am detaining you from more important
matters. Your Saturday's paper reached here at 4
o'clock, Saturday, 13th May, and, as it now appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
from the evidence taken before the coroner, several
persons left Auburn on the same errand, but without
any previous conference. Two of these were named
respectively Charles P. Gillson and Bartholomew Graham,
or, as he was usually called, "Black Bart."
Gillson kept a saloon at the corner of Prickly Ash
Street and the Old Spring Road; and Black Bart was
in the employ of Conrad &amp; Co., keepers of the Norfolk
livery stable. Gillson was a son-in-law of ex-Governor
Roberts, of Iowa, and leaves a wife and two children to
mourn his untimely end. As for Graham, nothing certain
is known of his antecedents. It is said that he
was engaged in the late robbery of Wells &amp; Fargo's
express at Grizzly Bend, and that he was an habitual
gambler. Only one thing about him is certainly well
known: he was a lieutenant in the Confederate army,
and served under General Price and the outlaw Quantrell.
He was a man originally of fine education,
plausible manners and good family; but strong drink
seems early in life to have overmastered him, and left
him but a wreck of himself. But he was not incapable
of generous, or rather, romantic, acts; for, during the
burning of the Putnam House, in this town, last summer,
he rescued two ladies from the flames. In so
doing he scorched his left hand so seriously as to contract
the tendons of two fingers, and this very scar may
lead to his apprehension. There is no doubt about his
utter desperation of character, and, if taken at all, it
will probably be not alive.</p>

<p>So much for the persons concerned in the tragedy at
the Flat.</p>

<p>Herewith I inclose copies of the testimony of the
witnesses examined before the coroner's jury, together
with the statement of Gillson, taken <i>in articulo mortis:</i></p>

<p>Said witness, being duly sworn, deposed as follows, to
wit: My name is Dollie Adams; my age forty-seven years;
I am the wife of Frank G. Adams, of this township, and
reside on the North Fork of the American River, below
Cape Horn, on Thompson's Flat; about one o'clock <span class="smsmcap">p. m.</span>,
May 14, 1871, I left the cabin to gather wood to cook
dinner for my husband and the hands at work for him on
the claim; the trees are mostly cut away from the bottom,
and I had to climb some distance up the mountain side
before I could get enough to kindle the fire; I had gone
about five hundred yards from the cabin, and was searching
for small sticks of fallen timber, when I thought I heard
some one groan, as if in pain; I paused and listened; the
groaning became more distinct, and I started at once for
the place whence the sounds proceeded; about ten steps off
I discovered the man whose remains lie there (pointing to
the deceased), sitting up, with his back against a big rock;
he looked so pale that I thought him already dead, but he
continued to moan until I reached his side; hearing me
approach, he opened his eyes, and begged me, "For God's
sake, give me a drop of water!" I asked him, "What
is the matter?" He replied, "I am shot in the back."
"Dangerously?" I demanded. "Fatally!" he faltered.
Without waiting to question him further, I returned to the
cabin, told Zenie&mdash;my daughter&mdash;what I had seen, and sent
her off on a run for the men. Taking with me a gourd of
water, some milk and bread&mdash;for I thought the poor gentleman
might be hungry and weak, as well as wounded&mdash;I
hurried back to his side, where I remained until "father"&mdash;as
we all call my husband&mdash;came with the men. We
removed him as gently as we could to the cabin; then sent
for Dr. Liebner, and nursed him until he died, yesterday,
just at sunset.</p>

<p class="secsc">DEPOSITION OF MISS X. V. ADAMS.</p>

<p>Being first duly sworn, witness testified as follows: My
name is Xixenia Volumnia Adams; I am the daughter of
Frank G. Adams and the last witness; I reside with them
on the Flat, and my age is eighteen years; a little past
1 o'clock on Sunday last my mother came running into the
house and informed me that a man was dying from a
wound, on the side-hill, and that I must go for father and
the boys immediately. I ran as fast as my legs would
carry me to where they were "cleaning up," for they never
cleaned up week-days on the Flat, and told the news; we
all came back together and proceeded to the spot where
the wounded man lay weltering in his blood; he was cautiously
removed to the cabin, where he lingered until
yesterday sundown, when he died.</p>

<p>Question. Did he speak after he reached the cabin?
A. He did frequently; at first with great pain, but afterward
more audibly and intelligibly.</p>

<p>Q. What did he say? A. First, to send for Squire
Jacobs, the Assistant District Attorney, as he had a statement
to make; and some time afterward, to send for his
wife; but we first of all sent for the doctor.</p>

<p>Q. Who was present when he died? A. Only myself;
he had appeared a great deal easier, and his wife had lain
down to take a short nap, and my mother had gone to the
spring and left me alone to watch; suddenly he lifted himself
spasmodically in bed, glared around wildly and muttered
something inaudible; seeing me, he cried out, "Run!
run! run! He has it! Black Bart has got the vial! Quick!
or he'll set the world afire! See, he opens it! Oh, my God!
Look! look! look! Hold his hands! tie him! chain him
down! Too late! too late! oh the flames! Fire! fire! fire!"
His tone of voice gradually strengthened until the end of
his raving; when he cried "fire!" his eyeballs glared, his
mouth quivered, his body convulsed, and before Mrs. Gillson
could reach his bedside he fell back stone dead.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="sigrpad">(Signed)</span>X. V. A<span class="smsmcap">dams.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Adams corroborated in every particular
that of his wife and daughter, but set forth
more fully the particulars of his demoniac ravings.
He would taste nothing from a glass or bottle, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
shuddered whenever any article of that sort met his
eyes. In fact, they had to remove from the room the
cups, tumblers, and even the castors. At times he
spoke rationally, but after the second day only in momentary
flashes of sanity.</p>

<p>The deposition of the attending physician, after giving
the general facts with regard to the sickness of the
patient and his subsequent demise, proceeded thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I found the patient weak, and suffering from loss of
blood and rest, and want of nourishment; occasionally
sane, but for the most part flighty and in a comatose condition.
The wound was an ordinary gunshot wound,
produced most probably by the ball of a navy revolver,
fired at the distance of ten paces. It entered the back
near the left clavicle, beneath the scapula, close to the
vertebrae between the intercostal spaces of the fifth and
sixth ribs; grazing the pericardium it traversed the mediastinum,
barely touching the &oelig;sophagus, and vena azygos,
but completely severing the thoracic duct, and lodging in
the xiphoid portion of the sternum. Necessarily fatal,
there was no reason, however, why the patient could not
linger for a week or more; but it is no less certain that from
the effect of the wound he ultimately died. I witnessed
the execution of the paper shown to me&mdash;as the statement
of deceased&mdash;at his request; and at the time of signing the
same he was in his perfect senses. It was taken down in
my presence by Jacobs, the Assistant District Attorney of
Placer County, and read over to the deceased before he
affixed his signature. I was not present when he breathed
his last, having been called away by my patients in the
town of Auburn, but I reached his bedside shortly afterward.
In my judgment, no amount of care or medical
attention could have prolonged his life more than a few
days.</p>

<p class="itheads"><i>Statement and Dying Confession of Charles P. Gillson, taken in articulo
mortis by George Simpson, Notary Public.</i></p>

<p>On the morning of Sunday, the 14th day of May, 1871,
I left Auburn alone in search of the body of the late Gregory
Summerfield, who was reported to have been pushed
from the cars at Cape Horn, in this county, by one Leonidas
Parker, since deceased. It was not fully light when I
reached the track of the Central Pacific Railroad. Having
mined at an early day on Thompson's Flat, at the foot of
the rocky promontory now called Cape Horn, I was familiar
with the zigzag paths leading down that steep precipice.
One was generally used as a descent, the other as an ascent
from the caon below. I chose the latter, as being the
freest from the chance of observation. It required the
greatest caution to thread the narrow gorge; but I finally
reached the rocky bench, about one thousand feet below
the grade of the railroad. It was now broad daylight, and
I commenced cautiously the search for Summerfield's body.
There is quite a dense undergrowth of shrubs thereabouts,
lining the interstices of the granite rocks so as to obscure
the vision even at a short distance. Brushing aside a thick
manzanita bush, I beheld the dead man at the same instant
of time that another person arrived like an apparition upon
the spot. It was Bartholomew Graham, known as "Black
Bart." We suddenly confronted each other, the skeleton
of Summerfield lying exactly between us. Our recognition
was mutual. Graham advanced and I did the same; he
stretched out his hand and we greeted one another across
the prostrate corpse.</p>

<p>Before releasing my hand, Black Bart exclaimed in a
hoarse whisper, "Swear, Gillson, in the presence of the
dead, that you will forever be faithful, never betray me,
and do exactly as I bid you, as long as you live!"</p>

<p>I looked him full in the eye. Fate sat there, cold and
remorseless as stone. I hesitated; with his left hand he
slightly raised the lappels of his coat, and grasped the
handle of a navy revolver.</p>

<p>"Swear!" again he cried.</p>

<p>As I gazed, his eyeballs assumed a greenish tint, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
brow darkened into a scowl. "As your confederate," I
answered, "never as your slave."</p>

<p>"Be it so!" was his only reply.</p>

<p>The body was lying upon its back, with the face upwards.
The vultures had despoiled the countenance of every vestige
of flesh, and left the sockets of the eyes empty. Snow
and ice and rain had done their work effectually upon the
exposed surfaces of his clothing, and the eagles had feasted
upon the entrails. But underneath, the thick beaver cloth
had served to protect the flesh, and there were some decaying
shreds left of what had once been the terrible but
accomplished Gregory Summerfield. A glance told us all
these things. But they did not interest me so much as
another spectacle, that almost froze my blood. In the
skeleton gripe of the right hand, interlaced within the
clenched bones, gleamed the wide-mouthed vial which was
the object of our mutual visit. Graham fell upon his
knees, and attempted to withdraw the prize from the grasp
of its dead possessor. But the bones were firm, and when
he finally succeeded in securing the bottle, by a sudden
wrench, I heard the skeleton fingers snap like pipe-stems.</p>

<p>"Hold this a moment, whilst I search the pockets," he
commanded.</p>

<p>I did as directed.</p>

<p>He then turned over the corpse, and thrusting his hand
into the inner breast-pocket, dragged out a roll of MSS.,
matted closely together and stained by the winter's rains.
A further search eventuated in finding a roll of small gold
coin, a set of deringer pistols, a mated double-edged dirk,
and a pair of silver-mounted spectacles. Hastily covering
over the body with leaves and branches cut from the embowering
shrubs, we shudderingly left the spot.</p>

<p>We slowly descended the gorge toward the banks of the
American River, until we arrived in a small but sequestered
thicket, where we threw ourselves upon the ground. Neither
had spoken a word since we left the scene above described.
Graham was the first to break the silence which to me had
become oppressive.</p>

<p>"Let us examine the vial and see if the contents are
safe."</p>

<p>I drew it forth from my pocket and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"Sealed hermetically, and perfectly secure," he added.
Saying this he deliberately wrapped it up in a handkerchief
and placed it in his bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>"What shall we do with our prize?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"<i>Our</i> prize?" As he said this he laughed derisively, and
cut a most scornful and threatening glance toward me.</p>

<p>"Yes," I rejoined firmly; "<i>our</i> prize!"</p>

<p>"Gillson," retorted Graham, "you must regard me as a
consummate simpleton, or yourself a Goliah. This bottle
is mine, and <i>mine</i> only. It is a great fortune for <i>one</i>, but
of less value than a toadstool for <i>two</i>. I am willing to
divide fairly. This secret would be of no service to a
coward. He would not dare to use it. Your share of the
robbery of the body shall be these MSS.; you can sell them
to some poor devil of a printer, and pay yourself for your
day's work."</p>

<p>Saying this he threw the bundle of MSS. at my feet; but
I disdained to touch them. Observing this, he gathered
them up safely and replaced them in his pocket. "As you
are unarmed," he said, "it would not be safe for you to be
seen in this neighborhood during daylight. We will both
spend the night here, and just before morning return to
Auburn. I will accompany you part of the distance."</p>

<p>With the <i>sangfroid</i> of a perfect desperado, he then
stretched himself out in the shadow of a small tree, drank
deeply from a whisky flagon which he produced, and pulling
his hat over his eyes, was soon asleep and snoring.
It was a long time before I could believe the evidence of
my own senses. Finally, I approached the ruffian, and
placed my hand on his shoulder. He did not stir a muscle.
I listened; I heard only the deep, slow breathing of profound
slumber. Resolved not to be balked and defrauded
by such a scoundrel, I stealthily withdrew the vial from his
pocket, and sprang to my feet, just in time to hear the click
of a revolver behind me. I was betrayed! I remember only
a dash and an explosion&mdash;a deathly sensation, a whirl of the
rocks and trees about me, a hideous imprecation from the
lips of my murderer, and I fell senseless to the earth. When
I awoke to consciousness it was past midnight. I looked up
at the stars, and recognized Lyra shining full in my face.
That constellation I knew passed the meridian at this season
of the year after twelve o'clock, and its slow march told me
that many weary hours would intervene before daylight.
My right arm was paralyzed, but I put forth my left, and it
rested in a pool of my own blood. "Oh, for one drop of
water!" I exclaimed, faintly; but only the low sighing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
night blast responded. Again I fainted. Shortly after daylight
I revived, and crawled to the spot where I was discovered
on the next day by the kind mistress of this cabin.
You know the rest. I accuse Bartholomew Graham of my
assassination. I do this in the perfect possession of my
senses, and with a full sense of my responsibility to
Almighty God.</p>

our esteemed San Francisco correspondent the following
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>M<span class="smsmcap">r.</span> E<span class="smsmcap">ditor</span>: On entering my office this morning I found
A bundle of MSS. which had been thrown in at the transom
over the door, labeled, "The Summerfield MSS." Attached
to them was an unsealed note from one Bartholomew
Graham, in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>D<span class="smsmcap">ear</span> S<span class="smsmcap">ir</span>: These are yours: you have earned them. I commend to

<p>A casual glance at the papers convinces me that they are
of great literary value. Summerfield's fame never burned
so brightly as it does over this grave. Will you publish the
MSS.?</p></div>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
